a bad influence on him,"

a big fucking apology,"

and he's not giving that to her."
"123","cue","00:06:32,040","00:06:36,440","Like, she's crying, and it's almost like
he couldn't care less."

-[Stella] Yeah."
"145","cue","00:07:32,840","00:07:36,000","I don't even know what was going
through his head for him to think"

"147","cue","00:07:37,640","00:07:41,320","when I had five other people run after me
and make sure I was okay,"

"149","cue","00:07:42,520","00:07:45,440","I thought that was so weak of him."

Or are you gonna come and talk to me?"

so we were just up there talking,"
"156","cue","00:08:05,760","00:08:09,880","and we decided to play Truth or Dare.

what you're saying to me?"
"160","cue","00:08:21,240","00:08:23,000","-[Mitchell] Yeah.
-And that's just what happened?"
"161","cue","00:08:23,080","00:08:25,120","That makes me feel like a fucking mug."
"162","cue","00:08:25,200","00:08:27,720","And me walking up there
and seeing her unbuckling your pants,"
"163","cue","00:08:27,800","00:08:31,880","and then you sit there and piss yourself
laughing, made me feel fucking sick."
"164","cue","00:08:32,840","00:08:33,840","Yeah."
"165","cue","00:08:33,919","00:08:36,559","And if you came up and saw a guy"

into a guy,"
"170","cue","00:08:47,120","00:08:51,120","and then it is so easy for him
to just throw it all away,"
"171","cue","00:08:51,200","00:08:54,520","because they don't fucking think,
and it really pisses me off"
"172","cue","00:08:54,600","00:08:56,400","that every single guy is the exact same."
"173","cue","00:08:57,600","00:09:00,080","So I think you're a fucking prick."
"174","cue","00:09:01,000","00:09:03,720","-Yeah.
-That was such a fucking dick move."
"175","cue","00:09:03,800","00:09:05,840","-Yeah.
-And I literally would never tolerate"
"176","cue","00:09:05,920","00:09:08,000","-a guy treating me like that.
-Yeah."
"177","cue","00:09:08,680","00:09:10,480","Yeah, I-I-I know."
"178","cue","00:09:11,560","00:09:14,640","I fucked up. It's really out of character
for me at the moment"
"179","cue","00:09:14,720","00:09:16,840","because I am so into you."
"180","cue","00:09:16,920","00:09:20,040","I honestly-- I don't know why."
"181","cue","00:09:20,680","00:09:24,000","I just thought I'd have a bit of fun,
and that's no excuse."
"182","cue","00:09:24,080","00:09:28,480","And it doesn't mean anything,
but there's no excuse for why I did that."
"183","cue","00:09:29,000","00:09:32,320","He keeps saying that he has
this, like, fuckboy side of him,"
"184","cue","00:09:32,400","00:09:33,560","and that's just who he is,"
"185","cue","00:09:33,640","00:09:36,080","and I'm like,
""If you can't change being a fuckboy,"
"186","cue","00:09:36,160","00:09:37,360","then what am I doing with you?"""
"187","cue","00:09:44,000","00:09:47,240","You literally sat there for ten minutes
reassuring me, and then you go up there,"
"188","cue","00:09:47,320","00:09:49,200","-and do something like that.
-Yeah, I know."
"189","cue","00:09:49,280","00:09:52,080","Yeah, and I honestly
do not trust you at all."
"190","cue","00:09:52,160","00:09:53,560","-One bit.
-Yeah."
"191","cue","00:09:54,360","00:09:59,040","Mitch has just proved to me
that he is not who I thought he was."
"192","cue","00:09:59,880","00:10:01,440","I'm not even gonna say sorry."
"193","cue","00:10:01,520","00:10:02,880","[narrator] <i>Wrong.</i>"
"194","cue","00:10:03,440","00:10:05,440","'Cause you--
I know you don't want to hear that."

"196","cue","00:10:07,400","00:10:10,080","-I don't think you're sorry either.
-I am."
"197","cue","00:10:13,480","00:10:17,400","Did he really think that he could play
that game and keep it a secret,"
"198","cue","00:10:17,480","00:10:20,000","and go to sleep next to me at night
and probably kiss me"
"199","cue","00:10:20,080","00:10:21,520","and do all the things,"
"200","cue","00:10:21,600","00:10:24,200","and just act like none of it happened."
"201","cue","00:10:24,920","00:10:28,480","I think that's what he would have done,
if I didn't walk in on it."
"202","cue","00:10:30,880","00:10:31,880","[sighs]"
"203","cue","00:10:55,480","00:10:56,680","It's gonna be all right."
"204","cue","00:10:57,240","00:11:00,480","[narrator] <i>It's been an explosive evening</i>

"210","cue","00:11:14,480","00:11:15,680","Yeah."
"211","cue","00:11:15,760","00:11:17,840","Oh, my God, Layla has no idea."
"212","cue","00:11:17,920","00:11:20,680","I have to say all of this,
'cause it's gonna be fucked."
"213","cue","00:11:21,720","00:11:23,920","-Just sit down.
-[Layla] Wait, what the fuck?"
"214","cue","00:11:24,000","00:11:25,480","-[Mitchell] Fuck me.
-[Jordan] Oh, shit."
"215","cue","00:11:25,560","00:11:26,680","She has no idea."
"216","cue","00:11:26,760","00:11:29,040","Oh, my God, she has no idea."

"220","cue","00:11:33,920","00:11:35,680","…and they start to play Truth or Dare."
"221","cue","00:11:35,760","00:11:37,840","Fuck off. Seriously?"
"222","cue","00:11:38,400","00:11:40,800","-[sighs] Really?
-You've missed all of this."
"223","cue","00:11:40,880","00:11:42,200","[Layla] I was in the bathroom."
"224","cue","00:11:42,280","00:11:45,840","Um, Callum has his three-way kiss
with the two new girls."
"225","cue","00:11:45,920","00:11:49,240","-Ew.
-Me and Claudia are spying."
"226","cue","00:11:49,960","00:11:51,120","-[Layla] Yeah.
-[Claudia chuckles]"
"227","cue","00:11:51,200","00:11:54,240","Then Callum dares the new girls
to take off Mitch's pants,"
"228","cue","00:11:54,320","00:11:56,640","-and to lick up--
-[Layla] Yeah."
"229","cue","00:11:56,720","00:11:57,880","And Mitch accepts this?"
"230","cue","00:11:57,960","00:11:59,920","So, I walk over there and stand there,"
"231","cue","00:12:00,000","00:12:02,840","and they all just
start pissing themselves laughing."
"232","cue","00:12:02,920","00:12:06,240","-And Callum, like, initiated all of this.
-[Layla groans]"
"233","cue","00:12:06,320","00:12:09,560","You're literally asking for it
if you're gonna play Truth or Dare,"
"234","cue","00:12:09,640","00:12:14,160","especially in a place like this villa
with the newest bombshells."

"236","cue","00:12:19,560","00:12:22,040","So, I'm gonna give you the rundown
from start to finish, okay?"
"237","cue","00:12:22,120","00:12:24,480","When I first saw you,
I was a bit attracted to you"
"238","cue","00:12:24,560","00:12:27,280","{\an8}-and I wanted to give you the time of day.
-[Vakoo] Mm-hmm."
"239","cue","00:12:27,360","00:12:29,160","{\an8}[Vakoo] Mm-hmm."
"240","cue","00:12:29,240","00:12:31,600","I didn't think it was gonna get
that naughty that quick."
"241","cue","00:12:31,680","00:12:33,760","And I don't know how
I'm gonna fucking tell Layla,"
"242","cue","00:12:33,840","00:12:35,280","that one minute, I'm telling her like,"
"243","cue","00:12:35,360","00:12:37,440","""I'm happy to progress
and keep doing what we're doing,"""
"244","cue","00:12:37,520","00:12:38,800","and the next minute I'm up there--"
"245","cue","00:12:38,880","00:12:40,400","But you said you're happy to progress,"
"246","cue","00:12:40,480","00:12:42,360","but also you're open
to getting to know us."
"247","cue","00:12:42,440","00:12:46,080","So, I have stuck to my words,
but I don't think getting to know you"
"248","cue","00:12:46,160","00:12:47,560","is kissing you and playing dare."
"249","cue","00:12:47,640","00:12:49,160","So do you just want to be with Layla,"
"250","cue","00:12:49,240","00:12:50,960","-and not get to know--
-[Callum] No, I don't."
"251","cue","00:12:51,040","00:12:53,800","I don't. I want to get to know--
I want to get to know you,"
"252","cue","00:12:53,880","00:12:57,120","but at the same time, I don't want
to be disrespectful to Layla,"
"253","cue","00:12:57,200","00:12:59,720","because I genuinely have
Layla's best interests at heart."
"254","cue","00:12:59,800","00:13:03,400","I feel like I can still love Layla
or like Layla a lot,"
"255","cue","00:13:03,480","00:13:06,080","but still tune other birds.
I'm not married to Layla."
"256","cue","00:13:06,160","00:13:07,200","It's good. It's healthy."
"257","cue","00:13:07,280","00:13:09,040","I missed all this in the bathroom?"
"258","cue","00:13:09,120","00:13:10,680","Healthy competition across the birds."
"259","cue","00:13:10,760","00:13:12,680","-That's what they need.
-The whole point of the game"
"260","cue","00:13:12,760","00:13:15,240","was so that they can just
break the ice with the girls."
"261","cue","00:13:15,320","00:13:17,840","-What do you mean break the ice?
-[Austen] That's what they thought."
"262","cue","00:13:17,920","00:13:19,480","Their intentions were good."
"263","cue","00:13:19,560","00:13:21,880","-[Mitchell] She's proper pissed.
-[Layla] Who-- Like, really?"
"264","cue","00:13:21,960","00:13:23,320","That's like-- It's fucking sad."
"265","cue","00:13:23,400","00:13:25,640","I can't listen. I can't listen.
I gotta go."
"266","cue","00:13:26,720","00:13:28,680","[blows raspberry]"
"267","cue","00:13:29,800","00:13:32,360","I'll be honest.
I kind of wanted to kiss you anyway,"
"268","cue","00:13:32,440","00:13:33,920","so I was going to kiss you anyway,"
"269","cue","00:13:34,000","00:13:36,560","even if it wasn't straightaway.
I wanted to kiss you."
"270","cue","00:13:36,640","00:13:39,120","Yeah, I don't know what to do
with that information,"
"271","cue","00:13:39,200","00:13:41,000","'cause I really want to kiss you."
"272","cue","00:13:44,040","00:13:45,720","-Where the fuck is he?
-[Maddy] I'm so sorry."
"273","cue","00:13:45,800","00:13:48,080","-No, it's fine. [scoffs]
-[Claudia] Yeah, go."
"274","cue","00:13:49,080","00:13:51,320","[Callum] My chat with Layla
is just gonna be like,"
"275","cue","00:13:51,400","00:13:53,080","I'm just gonna tell her--"
"276","cue","00:13:53,160","00:13:54,120","Me?"
"277","cue","00:13:56,680","00:13:58,000","I gotta go."
"278","cue","00:13:59,440","00:14:01,240","Oh, my God, are we not allowed to talk?"
"279","cue","00:14:02,880","00:14:04,440","[Layla] Are they fucking dumb?"
"280","cue","00:14:04,920","00:14:06,760","{\an8}[Al]"
"281","cue","00:14:12,000","00:14:13,120","Fuck."
"282","cue","00:14:20,840","00:14:24,120","Please rip him one. Proper, please,
'cause I've already done it."
"283","cue","00:14:24,200","00:14:25,320","[whispers] Oh, my God."
"284","cue","00:14:25,400","00:14:27,080","What the fuck?"
"285","cue","00:14:27,160","00:14:28,920","Oh, mate."
"286","cue","00:14:31,040","00:14:31,880","Yeah."
"287","cue","00:14:33,040","00:14:35,760","She's kicking off, bro.
Layla's kicking off."
"288","cue","00:14:35,840","00:14:37,400","[Callum chuckles]"
"289","cue","00:14:43,160","00:14:44,880","[Mitchell] Do you want me to come with?"
"290","cue","00:14:45,480","00:14:46,680","Hi."
"291","cue","00:14:47,720","00:14:48,600","-Hey.
-[Callum] Hey."
"292","cue","00:14:48,680","00:14:50,160","Want to have a little chat?"
"293","cue","00:14:51,880","00:14:53,200","He can leave."
"294","cue","00:14:54,040","00:14:55,080","I'll leave."
"295","cue","00:14:56,320","00:14:58,640","Yeah. Sit."
"296","cue","00:14:58,720","00:15:01,520","I'm fucking heated,
like, I just need to get it out."
"297","cue","00:15:01,600","00:15:04,480","Like, I'm fucking annoyed.
I want to know what happened."
"298","cue","00:15:04,560","00:15:05,800","What the fuck happened?"
"299","cue","00:15:06,960","00:15:08,640","I don't know. It just got carried away."
"300","cue","00:15:09,720","00:15:11,840","-Talk to me. I wanna know everything.
-Where have you been?"
"301","cue","00:15:11,920","00:15:13,400","[Layla] Tell me what happened."

for a chat upstairs."
"303","cue","00:15:17,680","00:15:18,760","Mitch came up."
"304","cue","00:15:18,840","00:15:21,360","Um, I was just like,
""Let's play Truth or Dare."""
"305","cue","00:15:21,440","00:15:23,160","It was dumb. I know it was dumb."
"306","cue","00:15:23,240","00:15:25,040","Yeah, it's a bit stupid, isn't it?"
"307","cue","00:15:25,120","00:15:27,000","Yeah, like I said-- I know. But I said--"
"308","cue","00:15:27,080","00:15:28,160","Say it."
"309","cue","00:15:28,240","00:15:31,560","-I don't know. Like me and--
-No, just say it. What happened?"
"310","cue","00:15:31,640","00:15:33,720","Yeah, so me and Mitch
were playing Truth or Dare."
"311","cue","00:15:33,800","00:15:36,600","Um, he gave me a dare,
and he was like, ""Kiss them both."""
"312","cue","00:15:37,400","00:15:38,560","-But--
-Both?"
"313","cue","00:15:38,640","00:15:40,080","He said it to me. He told me to do it,"
"314","cue","00:15:40,160","00:15:41,880","and I was like, ""That's the game."""
"315","cue","00:15:41,960","00:15:47,440","Them girls were encouraging it too,
and then I didn't get-- I don't know."
"316","cue","00:15:47,520","00:15:50,200","-And then, as soon as--
-You're 24 and 25, right?"
"317","cue","00:15:50,280","00:15:53,080","-Yeah.
-Come on. Like a Truth or Dare…"
"318","cue","00:15:53,160","00:15:55,960","Why don't you just fucking
ask them questions, like a normal guy?"
"319","cue","00:15:56,040","00:15:58,920","I know and that's why I said I regret
doing it. Of course I regret doing it."
"320","cue","00:16:00,080","00:16:01,640","I don't know, I'm sorry."
"321","cue","00:16:03,120","00:16:05,800","I just don't fucking understand
what went through your head."
"322","cue","00:16:05,880","00:16:08,240","I didn't mean to do it,
because I meant what I said beforehand."
"323","cue","00:16:08,320","00:16:10,240","That's what I'm saying.
Actions speak louder than words."
"324","cue","00:16:10,320","00:16:12,960","-Yeah.
-You can say-- Now, I feel like… [sighs]"
"325","cue","00:16:13,040","00:16:14,720","Now I'm gonna have fucking trust issues"
"326","cue","00:16:14,800","00:16:16,920","'cause you can say fucking
whatever you want,"
"327","cue","00:16:17,000","00:16:19,080","and next minute,
you do something else like that."
"328","cue","00:16:19,160","00:16:20,200","Like, it's hurtful."
"329","cue","00:16:20,280","00:16:22,840","-It is. I know.
-It's hurtful, and I care about you."
"330","cue","00:16:22,920","00:16:25,240","Yeah, and I care about you too,
and I know straightaway,"
"331","cue","00:16:25,320","00:16:27,840","as soon as that happened,
I was like, ""Holy fuck."""
"332","cue","00:16:28,440","00:16:31,360","-Yeah, holy fuck, get your shit together.
-Mm-hmm."
"333","cue","00:16:31,440","00:16:32,800","[Layla] It was really immature."
"334","cue","00:16:32,880","00:16:35,200","I don't know how to feel.
I don't know what to feel."
"335","cue","00:16:35,280","00:16:38,200","I've never really been
in this sort of situation."
"336","cue","00:16:38,280","00:16:41,160","Yeah, but it wasn't a kiss
and like just the two of us."
"337","cue","00:16:41,240","00:16:43,520","At least it was a three-way,
because it's better. Right?"

-[Layla laughs]"
"340","cue","00:16:47,120","00:16:48,800","A three-way kiss is better
than a one-way kiss,"

that's a bit more serious."

-Yeah, you have."
"346","cue","00:17:02,800","00:17:05,880","I feel like I let you down a little bit,
and I said once, ""I'm changing."""

You do bring the best out of me,"
"348","cue","00:17:09,040","00:17:12,359","and I thought, ""I'm going to be better,""
but I'm not really, am I?"
"349","cue","00:17:12,440","00:17:14,520","-I was happy with how we were going.
-Yeah, me too."
"350","cue","00:17:14,599","00:17:16,560","And I still think we can,

"352","cue","00:17:21,560","00:17:23,560","And I still want to sleep in the bed
with you."
"353","cue","00:17:23,640","00:17:25,440","I don't want to sleep on my own."
"354","cue","00:17:25,960","00:17:27,520","He was very remorseful."
"355","cue","00:17:27,599","00:17:30,560","And he said he felt really bad.
And he couldn't even look at me."
"356","cue","00:17:33,880","00:17:35,760","[sighs]"
"357","cue","00:17:35,840","00:17:39,960","Yeah, he was saying
all the right things, you know?"
"358","cue","00:17:40,040","00:17:42,160","Yeah, I just want to know.
So, where do you stand?"
"359","cue","00:17:42,240","00:17:44,200","Like, are you wanting
to get to know the other girls?"
"360","cue","00:17:44,280","00:17:45,280","No."
"361","cue","00:17:46,120","00:17:47,760","-No? Not at all?
-No."
"362","cue","00:17:47,840","00:17:49,360","You've told me you want to invest."
"363","cue","00:17:52,600","00:17:54,480","-Yeah, I do.
-And I want to invest too."
"364","cue","00:17:54,560","00:17:56,280","-I really do.
-Yeah, me too."
"365","cue","00:17:56,360","00:17:58,800","And I mean that,
so I might have fucked up,"
"366","cue","00:17:58,880","00:18:00,120","but I meant what I said."
"367","cue","00:18:00,200","00:18:02,280","And when you said to me
that you've put more eggs in me,"
"368","cue","00:18:02,360","00:18:04,640","it made me really happy,
because I want to put more eggs in you."
"369","cue","00:18:04,720","00:18:06,800","Look, I'm not gonna lie,
you did have nine eggs,"
"370","cue","00:18:06,880","00:18:08,880","but now you have eight and half."
"371","cue","00:18:10,280","00:18:11,480","Almost eight."
"372","cue","00:18:11,560","00:18:13,160","Eight and a half is good."
"373","cue","00:18:13,240","00:18:18,320","You got-- I'm taking half an egg out
for what the fuck you just did."
"374","cue","00:18:19,000","00:18:20,000","Come on."
"375","cue","00:18:20,600","00:18:22,320","I did accept his apology."
"376","cue","00:18:23,320","00:18:27,080","He was so cute
when he said sorry, and like--"
"377","cue","00:18:27,160","00:18:28,000","[inhales deeply]"
"378","cue","00:18:31,080","00:18:35,160","Am I stupid for trusting someone
when they say something?"
"379","cue","00:18:35,720","00:18:38,280","Like, am I that naive? Maybe I am.
I don't know."
"380","cue","00:18:39,240","00:18:40,640","Where's Phoebe?"
"381","cue","00:18:41,640","00:18:43,560","Phoebe, you want to come for a chat?"

-Yeah, bro."
"391","cue","00:19:07,000","00:19:10,320","-Did you get roasted?

"393","cue","00:19:13,880","00:19:15,800","-Fun.

"395","cue","00:19:16,920","00:19:23,400","-[sighs] Hi. How are you?
-[Phoebe H] Hello. Um, could be better."
"396","cue","00:19:23,480","00:19:25,680","-I mean, welcome to <i>Love Island.</i>
-[Vakoo] Yeah."
"397","cue","00:19:25,760","00:19:26,600","Yeah."
"398","cue","00:19:26,680","00:19:32,440","I definitely felt like the chat with Layla
was definitely, like, a warning."
"399","cue","00:19:32,520","00:19:33,600","I just wanted to talk to you."
"400","cue","00:19:33,680","00:19:35,880","I didn't want to make it feel
awkward or anything with you."
"401","cue","00:19:35,960","00:19:38,800","It's your first night.
Like, you know, no hard feelings."
"402","cue","00:19:38,880","00:19:41,720","I understand. It wasn't like--
You had no boundaries to cross."
"403","cue","00:19:41,800","00:19:44,440","-It was them, and they did.
-[Vakoo] Yeah."
"404","cue","00:19:44,520","00:19:46,800","We understand you guys
have connections already."
"405","cue","00:19:46,880","00:19:49,200","We can't control when we came in
and it's just--"
"406","cue","00:19:49,280","00:19:51,920","I know. It's so hard. It is so hard."
"407","cue","00:19:52,000","00:19:57,760","I only just wish that more guys
were available for you girls."
"408","cue","00:20:01,960","00:20:04,080","Because you girls do seem really lovely"
"409","cue","00:20:04,160","00:20:06,280","and we want everyone
to find someone obviously…"
"410","cue","00:20:06,360","00:20:08,920","-Yeah.
-…so it does obviously suck."
"411","cue","00:20:09,000","00:20:12,920","-But, yeah, just don't go near my man.
-[Vakoo] Yeah."
"412","cue","00:20:15,960","00:20:17,640","Babe? You know?"
"413","cue","00:20:17,720","00:20:19,600","-Like…
-[laughs]"
"414","cue","00:20:19,680","00:20:23,320","We're just getting to know each other.
I don't see there's any harm in that."
"415","cue","00:20:23,400","00:20:27,640","So I think it is a bit much for Layla
to just be like,"
"416","cue","00:20:27,720","00:20:30,080","""That's my man. Stay away."""
"417","cue","00:20:40,920","00:20:44,200","And then he goes,
""I'm not gonna say sorry,"
"418","cue","00:20:44,280","00:20:47,280","because you probably don't even
want to hear that either."""
"419","cue","00:20:49,160","00:20:51,360","-[scoffs] That's his fuckboy tendency.
-[Phoebe] And he goes,"
"420","cue","00:20:51,440","00:20:54,280","""It's just my fuckboy tendency
to do things like that."""
"421","cue","00:20:55,520","00:20:58,280","Yeah, I probably
will not be sleeping tonight,"
"422","cue","00:20:58,880","00:21:02,920","but I hope I do get to sleep
because I just need my brain to rest."
"423","cue","00:21:03,000","00:21:04,240","It's been a big night."
"424","cue","00:21:08,200","00:21:09,720","[inhales] Oh, my God, my head."
"425","cue","00:21:09,800","00:21:12,520","I have no idea
where the fuck my head is at still."

"427","cue","00:21:13,960","00:21:16,920","[sighs] Like I think I just need
to talk to Callum in bed,"
"428","cue","00:21:17,000","00:21:19,400","and just break everything down."

"437","cue","00:21:51,720","00:21:54,840","is, like, we don't talk to girls in here,"

what he was gonna say to her,"

-[Austen] How was the kiss, Mitch?"
"845","cue","00:42:46,640","00:42:48,600","-Rubbish.

"846","cue","00:42:50,440","00:42:52,200","[Mitchell] Yeah, the kiss with new Phoebe,"
"847","cue","00:42:52,280","00:42:54,040","I did say it was rubbish,"
"848","cue","00:42:54,120","00:42:57,800","but I knew OG Phoebe was listening,
so I said, ""Yeah, it was rubbish."""

It just made her even more banging."
"868","cue","00:44:05,840","00:44:07,040","So she's banging, banging."

You're her partner."

a whole lot of fake beard,"

"879","cue","00:44:50,320","00:44:52,800","It was like a weird, weirdo kiss."

so you couldn't guess."

I don't believe-- Yeah, it's--"

"895","cue","00:45:54,200","00:45:57,640","but there's feelings involved,

It just seemed familiar."
"897","cue","00:46:03,120","00:46:04,680","The taste and the lips."

You're actually a dog."

-[Maddy] Out of the challenge."

a bit of fun with it."

-Explain that to the girls."

"921","cue","00:47:23,960","00:47:26,520","I just want her to crunch it up in a ball
and just throw it."

that happened last night,"
"923","cue","00:47:29,320","00:47:34,160","I don't think today's behavior
was a very respectful way to go about it."

so crazy about it."

little lads on, like, a boys' trip away."

That's what's supposed to happen."
"929","cue","00:47:48,920","00:47:50,680","It's normal.
And this is what I'm trying to do."
"930","cue","00:47:50,760","00:47:53,760","I'm trying to test relationships
to see if they actually are solid."
"931","cue","00:47:53,840","00:47:56,480","If everyone has it smooth sailing,
you could be smooth"
"932","cue","00:47:56,560","00:47:58,640","and loved up as hell,
you go out into the real world,"
"933","cue","00:47:58,720","00:48:01,000","-and you have obstacles…
-[Mitchell] Yeah."
"934","cue","00:48:01,080","00:48:02,920","…then all of a sudden
your relationship breaks down."
"935","cue","00:48:03,000","00:48:05,200","Did anyone kiss you
that wasn't one of these two?"
"936","cue","00:48:05,880","00:48:07,760","-Jordan.
-Jordan did?"

-I didn't kiss her."
"938","cue","00:48:09,400","00:48:11,160","And the reason
why I picked Jordan to kiss Phoebe…"
"939","cue","00:48:11,240","00:48:12,360","-I did kiss you.
-You kissed me."
"940","cue","00:48:12,440","00:48:15,560","…is because the thing didn't land
on Jordan,"
"941","cue","00:48:15,640","00:48:18,160","and I made sure to change it to Jordan
because I know"
"942","cue","00:48:18,240","00:48:21,440","that Phoebe and Jordan had a connection,
and she likes him,"
"943","cue","00:48:21,520","00:48:22,840","and he's her first pick."
"944","cue","00:48:22,920","00:48:25,360","I don't think a tiger ever changes
its stripes,"
"945","cue","00:48:25,440","00:48:28,840","so unfortunately
I think this will continue on,"
"946","cue","00:48:28,920","00:48:30,560","and it's really up to the girls to decide"
"947","cue","00:48:30,640","00:48:32,880","whether they wanna put up
with that or not."
"948","cue","00:48:32,960","00:48:35,920","You were able to come in this villa
and see the relationships,"
"949","cue","00:48:36,000","00:48:37,360","and you still picked Mitch,"
"950","cue","00:48:37,440","00:48:40,320","even though you knew Phoebe and Mitch
were the strongest couple in here."
"951","cue","00:48:40,400","00:48:42,680","They were the strongest couple in here.
It was perfectly clear."
"952","cue","00:48:42,760","00:48:44,600","-And you still picked Mitch.
-So?"
"953","cue","00:48:44,680","00:48:46,440","That's exactly my point. You can't be mad."
"954","cue","00:48:46,520","00:48:48,760","I didn't do it to be malicious.
I didn't do it to piss Phoebe off."
"955","cue","00:48:48,840","00:48:52,040","-I'm not doing it to be malicious.
-'Cause it looks like you guys did it"
"956","cue","00:48:52,120","00:48:54,400","just to piss your girlfriends--
""girls""-- off."
"957","cue","00:48:54,480","00:48:56,400","So all those girls
are not angry at the boys,"
"958","cue","00:48:56,480","00:48:58,440","-they're angry at me and Callum?
-Yes."
"959","cue","00:48:58,520","00:49:00,960","I just wanna start by saying
if those girls go back to them…"
"960","cue","00:49:01,040","00:49:02,960","-[Jess] They're stupid.
-[Claudia] …they are so stupid."
"961","cue","00:49:03,040","00:49:04,440","-[Jess] They're so fucking dumb.
-[Stella] I know."
"962","cue","00:49:04,520","00:49:06,440","-I would drop guys--
-I agree."
"963","cue","00:49:06,520","00:49:08,400","-What the fuck was that?
-That was so disrespectful."
"964","cue","00:49:08,480","00:49:09,480","I know myself."
"965","cue","00:49:09,560","00:49:13,840","If a guy treated me the way
they treated those girls, I would be done."
"966","cue","00:49:13,920","00:49:16,000","What are you gonna do when Callum
and Mitch talk to you?"
"967","cue","00:49:16,080","00:49:18,640","-I honestly do not wanna look at them.
-I couldn't tolerate that behavior."
"968","cue","00:49:18,720","00:49:20,680","Too much at the expense
of other people's feelings."
"969","cue","00:49:20,760","00:49:23,040","-[Jess] Yeah.
-You are hurting so many people,"
"970","cue","00:49:23,120","00:49:25,680","and what,
just to look like a fucking idiot?"
"971","cue","00:49:25,760","00:49:27,840","He's made himself look like a proper tool."
"972","cue","00:49:28,480","00:49:30,520","-See, not even I can play nice.
-[Claudia] No, I know."
"973","cue","00:49:30,600","00:49:33,400","[Jess] No, I can't. That's how you know
what they did was fucked."
"974","cue","00:49:33,480","00:49:35,320","-That's not even our boys.
-[Jess] I know. [laughs]"
"975","cue","00:49:35,400","00:49:37,680","-And we're more mad than them.
-[Jess] Yeah, imagine if it was our boys."
"976","cue","00:49:37,760","00:49:39,040","-Layla--
-Layla's pissing me off"
"977","cue","00:49:39,120","00:49:41,080","because it's like,
are you actually taking the piss?"
"978","cue","00:49:41,160","00:49:44,160","Are you actually dumb
to let Callum walk all over you?"
"979","cue","00:49:44,240","00:49:45,800","And she tries to make it out like,"
"980","cue","00:49:45,880","00:49:48,160","""Oh, no, you know. It's fine. It's fine."""
"981","cue","00:49:48,240","00:49:50,640","And I'm like, ""Honey,
he doesn't give a fuck about you."""
"982","cue","00:49:50,720","00:49:54,000","She won't listen to anything you say.
Anything you say, she will not listen."
"983","cue","00:49:54,080","00:49:57,960","I want to be Layla's big sister
and help her out."
"984","cue","00:49:58,040","00:50:00,280","I don't care if she stays with him.
I don't care if she doesn't."
"985","cue","00:50:00,360","00:50:02,360","I just want her to know
that was disrespectful,"
"986","cue","00:50:02,440","00:50:04,280","what these boys have put her through."
"987","cue","00:50:04,360","00:50:06,960","I really think your opinions are valid
and everything,"
"988","cue","00:50:07,040","00:50:10,720","but I feel like if I keep hearing them,
I'm getting more confused"
"989","cue","00:50:10,800","00:50:13,320","and I just need to listen to my gut
and my heart and just--"

as easily as you did last night,"
"991","cue","00:50:15,800","00:50:19,160","you're going to look like a fucking idiot.
There's no way around it."
"992","cue","00:50:19,240","00:50:22,880","I don't-- It's hard. I don't-- See,
this is what I mean. Like, I don't know."

I think it's just harder when everyone--"

and mine's different, and I'm like,"
"996","cue","00:50:31,360","00:50:33,280","-""Maybe, am I wrong?""
-We just don't want you to look--"
"997","cue","00:50:33,360","00:50:36,400","But, yet again, I know who I am.
I know what I want."

"1002","cue","00:50:47,160","00:50:49,800","A challenge is a challenge.
We're on <i>Love Island</i>."

-Yeah."
"1004","cue","00:50:51,800","00:50:55,160","-Okay.
-That's what you girls don't understand."

I think at the moment it's because they…"

is like talking to a brick wall."
