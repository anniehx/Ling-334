[scoffs]"
"169","cue","00:08:33,039","00:08:35,799","Would I be able to talk to you guys
in a private setting?"
"170","cue","00:08:35,880","00:08:37,240","-Yeah.
-Yeah?"
"171","cue","00:08:37,320","00:08:39,840","-Just over there?
-I'm feeling a bit angry."
"172","cue","00:08:40,360","00:08:42,919","It's been really difficult for me"
"173","cue","00:08:43,000","00:08:47,360","because I've really put myself
on the line for Jordan,"
"174","cue","00:08:47,440","00:08:49,800","and like he won't give that with me"
"175","cue","00:08:49,880","00:08:53,200","but he'll sit there and give that
with Phoebe, in front of me."
"176","cue","00:08:53,280","00:08:56,400","And it's kind of-- [inhales sharply]
it's a bit frustrating for me to see."
"177","cue","00:08:56,480","00:08:59,360","'Cause I'm going, ""Well, hang on a minute.
[scoffs] I'm here."""

is not about me right now"

"181","cue","00:09:07,480","00:09:09,760","I'm trying to respect Jordan
and give him his space"

""Hey, I'm here and I want this."""

he doesn't want to jump into anything."

"185","cue","00:09:19,560","00:09:24,280","Then I'm like, ""Why the fuck
are you constantly hugging Phoebe?"""

and then he's like to her"

"188","cue","00:09:32,600","00:09:36,040","Jordan, just back your ideas up, man,
for fuck's sake."
"189","cue","00:09:36,120","00:09:38,440","[Holly] I want them to be so good."
"190","cue","00:09:38,520","00:09:40,960","Just bloody get in there."
"191","cue","00:09:41,040","00:09:43,760","I feel like he's got
this little bit of a macho man side"
"192","cue","00:09:43,840","00:09:45,840","and I just-- I want it to come out."
"193","cue","00:09:45,920","00:09:50,080","I want him to rip his shirt off

I want someone to like me back."

-Mm-hmm."
"198","cue","00:09:59,520","00:10:01,000","And why the fuck is it"
"199","cue","00:10:01,080","00:10:03,080","that I'm respecting you so fucking much"
"200","cue","00:10:03,160","00:10:05,560","and then you'll just fucking flounce
all over some girl"
"201","cue","00:10:05,640","00:10:06,800","-all day in front of me?
-Yeah."
"202","cue","00:10:07,920","00:10:10,200","You can't say to me
that you want to take things slow"

all over another girl,"
"204","cue","00:10:12,480","00:10:13,960","even if it is as a ""friend""."

-I just didn't see it like that one bit."

-Because it was so innocent."
"228","cue","00:11:27,040","00:11:30,160","Yeah. And Phoebe is a very touchy person."
"229","cue","00:11:31,760","00:11:32,600","Hmm."
"230","cue","00:11:32,680","00:11:36,800","It was just-- She was just a bit like,
""Why her and not me?"""
"231","cue","00:11:36,880","00:11:41,720","And I just had to explain, like, why.
Like, Phoebe is a friend."
"232","cue","00:11:41,800","00:11:44,120","We just click.
It's just as simple as that."
"233","cue","00:11:44,200","00:11:46,520","-If you look at it from my perspective…
-Yeah."

-Yeah."
"236","cue","00:11:51,680","00:11:56,280","And I get it. Like, I-I truly believe
that, um, males and females"

best friends and stuff like that."

just show me a bit more effort,"
"252","cue","00:12:36,040","00:12:37,360","like, you care about me."
"253","cue","00:12:37,440","00:12:41,480","Obviously my walls are up
from the past situation I've been through."
"254","cue","00:12:41,560","00:12:44,160","Your emotions can get hurt
very easily in here."

you gotta look for new connections"
"256","cue","00:12:48,160","00:12:49,400","and I do like Stella."

towards Al, you know?"
