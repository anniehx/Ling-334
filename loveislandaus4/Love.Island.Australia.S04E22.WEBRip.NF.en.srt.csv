"339","cue","00:17:51,880","00:17:53,680","[Madeline] Hello. [chuckles]"
"340","cue","00:17:53,760","00:17:56,680","-Meet Mads, Maddy, Madeline.
-Hello, everyone."
"341","cue","00:17:57,200","00:17:59,440","Aw, it's a hot chick sitting on the couch."
"342","cue","00:17:59,520","00:18:00,960","Like, why?"
"343","cue","00:18:01,040","00:18:02,080","[Madeline] Hello."
"344","cue","00:18:02,160","00:18:03,440","-Hi.
-[Tina] Hi."
"345","cue","00:18:03,520","00:18:04,920","Oh, my God."
"346","cue","00:18:05,000","00:18:06,360","-Fuck.
-[Callum laughing]"
"347","cue","00:18:06,440","00:18:07,400","Are you freaking kidding me?"
"348","cue","00:18:07,480","00:18:10,360","I can't even--
I haven't even woken up yet."
"349","cue","00:18:10,440","00:18:14,720","I've still got crust in my eyes, but
through the crust, I can see some chick."
"350","cue","00:18:14,800","00:18:17,040","And I was like, ""What's she doing here?"""
"351","cue","00:18:17,720","00:18:18,720","Get out."
"352","cue","00:18:29,200","00:18:30,360","He said he was open yesterday though."
"353","cue","00:18:30,440","00:18:32,920","-How was your chat with the boys outside?
-[Madeline] Good."
"354","cue","00:18:33,000","00:18:35,560","-It was good?
-Yeah, it was good. Good chats."
"355","cue","00:18:36,160","00:18:37,520","They're all a bit of a vibe, hey?"
"356","cue","00:18:37,600","00:18:38,560","-[Phoebe H] Yeah?
-Yeah."
"357","cue","00:18:38,640","00:18:40,840","-Here he is.
-Hello, ladies."
"358","cue","00:18:40,920","00:18:41,920","Hi. Thanks."
"359","cue","00:18:42,000","00:18:45,880","I mean, looking at her, yeah, she's hot,
but she's obviously not me."
"360","cue","00:18:45,960","00:18:49,320","So I was like,
""Whatever. I have nothing to worry about."""
"361","cue","00:18:49,400","00:18:51,520","I'm a ten out of ten
and Al's in it just for me."
"362","cue","00:18:51,600","00:18:54,520","-I want to know what Al said to you.
-He was pretty flirty."
"363","cue","00:18:54,600","00:18:56,000","-Okay. Can you--
-He's a flirty person."
"364","cue","00:18:56,080","00:18:57,440","Can you tell me what he said?"
"365","cue","00:18:57,520","00:18:59,400","He's got--
I feel like he's got a flirty personality."
"366","cue","00:19:00,000","00:19:01,280","Can you tell me what he said?"
"367","cue","00:19:01,360","00:19:03,760","[Tina] You lied to me.
And we're gonna talk about it coming up."
"368","cue","00:19:03,840","00:19:05,920","[stammers] I can't even recall
what he said, to be honest."
"369","cue","00:19:06,000","00:19:07,200","Just being flirty."
"370","cue","00:19:07,280","00:19:09,760","He was putting out the vibes that he was…
You know?"
"371","cue","00:19:20,360","00:19:25,400","Nah. Like, I just felt my heart just sink,
and I was like, ""Wow."""
"372","cue","00:19:25,480","00:19:27,920","Like, I think I'm just being played."
"373","cue","00:19:29,600","00:19:30,600","How was your sleep?"
"374","cue","00:19:31,120","00:19:33,600","I slept good. Yours was interrupted?"
"375","cue","00:19:34,240","00:19:35,280","Yeah."
"376","cue","00:19:35,360","00:19:36,720","-You like the tea?
-Yeah."
"377","cue","00:19:36,800","00:19:38,240","-Can I have a sip?
-Yeah."
"378","cue","00:19:41,600","00:19:43,080","I made it with extra love this morning."
"379","cue","00:19:43,160","00:19:45,000","-Did you? Extra love?
-[chuckles]"
"380","cue","00:19:45,080","00:19:48,200","I think you made it
with a bit of an open mind."
"381","cue","00:19:48,280","00:19:50,720","What? What are you saying, ""open mind""?
Why do people say that?"
"382","cue","00:19:50,800","00:19:52,480","-'Cause--
-Is that 'cause of the Truth Bike?"
"383","cue","00:19:52,560","00:19:54,800","No, 'cause I heard something this morning."
"384","cue","00:19:54,880","00:19:56,360","Honest, I never said the word ""open."""
"385","cue","00:19:56,880","00:19:57,960","It doesn't matter."
"386","cue","00:19:58,040","00:19:59,640","That's-- I heard otherwise."
"387","cue","00:19:59,720","00:20:01,680","-Well, who told you that?
-Phoebe and Claudia."
"388","cue","00:20:01,760","00:20:03,800","-How do the girls know that?
-From the boys."
"389","cue","00:20:03,880","00:20:05,320","Apparently, you said that to her."
"390","cue","00:20:05,400","00:20:06,640","I didn't say that to her."
"391","cue","00:20:06,720","00:20:09,440","How would they know that?
I never said the word ""open."""
"392","cue","00:20:09,520","00:20:12,320","-What impression did you give her?
-I didn't give any impression."
"393","cue","00:20:12,400","00:20:14,000","Then why are the boys saying that?"
"394","cue","00:20:14,080","00:20:15,920","I don't know
what those fuckers are saying."
"395","cue","00:20:16,000","00:20:19,720","Jess reckons I sat down and I said,
I'm very open to getting to know her."
"396","cue","00:20:19,800","00:20:21,040","Nah, it's been twisted."
"397","cue","00:20:21,120","00:20:24,000","-How fucking twisted is that?
-Then why are the girls telling me that?"
"398","cue","00:20:24,080","00:20:25,080","-Jess.
-I've never flirt--"
"399","cue","00:20:25,160","00:20:27,920","Why are you listening to other people
but not Al?"
"400","cue","00:20:28,000","00:20:29,920","-[Al] She doesn't--
-That's the thing,"
"401","cue","00:20:30,000","00:20:33,240","You gotta trust Al and what he's saying.
You can't listen to everyone else."
"402","cue","00:20:33,320","00:20:35,840","Then why are you telling your couples
that he said he's open--"
"403","cue","00:20:35,920","00:20:37,600","I never said anything to Claudia."
"404","cue","00:20:37,680","00:20:39,600","Then why am I hearing it from them?"
"405","cue","00:20:39,680","00:20:42,800","He's told you from day one
to get to know other bombs."
"406","cue","00:20:42,880","00:20:43,960","[Al] In fact, yeah."
"407","cue","00:20:44,040","00:20:46,160","And he's told you
he's gonna get to know other bombshells."
"408","cue","00:20:46,240","00:20:48,000","That's not the problem, Callum."
"409","cue","00:20:48,080","00:20:51,680","And anyway, I don't even want to hear
from you, so don't get into my business."
"410","cue","00:20:51,760","00:20:53,440","Why did you call them?"
"411","cue","00:20:53,520","00:20:54,960","Because you're involving them."
"412","cue","00:20:55,760","00:20:59,320","-If Al is telling you he didn't say that--
-Exactly, you should believe Al."
"413","cue","00:20:59,400","00:21:02,760","You know what? This conversation
is not even over, so stop interjecting."
"414","cue","00:21:02,840","00:21:05,880","-Okay, we'll stay out of it.
-[Al] J-Jess. Jess. Jess."
"415","cue","00:21:05,960","00:21:07,240","-Wanna go somewhere else?
-Yeah."
"416","cue","00:21:07,840","00:21:10,600","-[Mitchell] She can't just ask us--
-Fucking sick of the boys."
"417","cue","00:21:11,120","00:21:14,080","With me and Al,
it was an A and B conversation."
"418","cue","00:21:14,160","00:21:18,000","I think it's appropriate for the boys
to see themselves out of it."
"419","cue","00:21:18,080","00:21:19,960","I think they don't know the full story."
"420","cue","00:21:20,040","00:21:22,200","They don't know
what Al and I are talking about it."
"421","cue","00:21:22,280","00:21:24,600","Their input is null and void."
"422","cue","00:21:25,680","00:21:29,080","Ah, look, I want to give you the assurance
right now, that you're in the clear."
"423","cue","00:21:30,200","00:21:34,160","Yeah, we'll chat, we'll talk to Mads,
but it's not like--"
"424","cue","00:21:34,240","00:21:37,240","I didn't see the initial click at all."
"425","cue","00:21:37,880","00:21:39,320","I want to know who said that then."
"426","cue","00:21:39,400","00:21:42,680","I want to know which one of the boys
are stirring shit if you didn't say that."
"427","cue","00:21:42,760","00:21:45,120","'Cause now that's really pissed me off.
That's not fair."
"428","cue","00:21:45,640","00:21:47,680","How much reassurance
do I have to give you?"
"429","cue","00:21:48,320","00:21:50,400","I'm always having to give you reassurance,"
"430","cue","00:21:50,480","00:21:54,040","and I feel like if this is gonna happen
on the outside, it's draining, man."
"431","cue","00:21:54,680","00:21:59,000","It's really frustrating
how things get turned around in the villa,"
"432","cue","00:21:59,080","00:22:00,400","how words get twisted."
"433","cue","00:22:00,480","00:22:04,320","I say one thing and, you know, it goes
through two, three different people,"
"434","cue","00:22:04,400","00:22:06,480","and then by the time it gets to Jess,"
"435","cue","00:22:06,560","00:22:08,840","it's a completely different sentence
with a different context."
"436","cue","00:22:09,720","00:22:12,760","-I wouldn't have-- Al.
-You don't have any confidence in us."
"437","cue","00:22:12,840","00:22:16,640","I would not have asked for any of this
if I didn't hear the stuff that I heard."
"438","cue","00:22:16,720","00:22:18,240","And that came from them."
"439","cue","00:22:18,320","00:22:20,320","Can you not, like, listen to people"
"440","cue","00:22:20,400","00:22:22,520","and just have confidence in yourself
and what we have already?"
"441","cue","00:22:22,600","00:22:25,240","This is gonna keep going.
Then what happens on the outside?"
"442","cue","00:22:25,320","00:22:26,840","'Cause I've been thinking
about us on the outside,"
"443","cue","00:22:26,920","00:22:29,440","and I'm confident we'll work.
But then if this keeps--"
"444","cue","00:22:29,520","00:22:32,280","Then there's gonna be not just one girl.
There's gonna be 100 different girls."
"445","cue","00:22:32,360","00:22:34,920","On the outside, it's gonna be
a lot harder, ten times harder."
"446","cue","00:22:35,000","00:22:40,040","Say a girl comes up to me and talks to me.
Someone takes a photo, sends it to Jess."
"447","cue","00:22:40,120","00:22:41,600","Jess will probably just see red"
"448","cue","00:22:41,680","00:22:44,440","and automatically think I'm cheating
or doing something wrong."
"449","cue","00:22:44,960","00:22:48,280","Where, um--
Where she's really just got to calm down"
"450","cue","00:22:48,360","00:22:51,040","and not just think of
the worst-case scenario."
"451","cue","00:22:52,120","00:22:54,560","-Jess, do you want us to work?
-Obviously."
"452","cue","00:22:56,040","00:22:58,680","But I'm not going to change myself
as a person for someone."
"453","cue","00:22:58,760","00:23:03,000","I'm the type of person that
if that happens, I don't stand for it."
"454","cue","00:23:03,080","00:23:06,320","And if you can't cope with that, Al, if
you just want to be happy, roses, daisies,"
"455","cue","00:23:06,400","00:23:08,520","then maybe
you're not ready for a relationship."
"456","cue","00:23:08,600","00:23:10,880","Because a relationship is hard work."
"457","cue","00:23:10,960","00:23:12,360","I'm here for a relationship."
"458","cue","00:23:12,440","00:23:14,560","And I've got confidence in us,
but you clearly don't."
"459","cue","00:23:34,840","00:23:36,040","[narrator] <i>After the hideaway,</i>"
"460","cue","00:23:36,120","00:23:40,400","<i>Jess was upset to hear</i>

"461","cue","00:23:40,480","00:23:43,480","<i>which he denies but our footage doesn't.</i>"
"462","cue","00:23:43,560","00:23:47,240","<i>Regardless, they've resolved their issues</i>

"464","cue","00:23:51,320","00:23:54,000","[Austen] I want to clear something up.
I'm not-- We're not laughing at you, Jess."
"465","cue","00:23:54,080","00:23:55,720","-Okay.
-I don't care. It just looked--"
"466","cue","00:23:55,800","00:23:58,680","I just think the way you were
interjecting in our conversations"
"467","cue","00:23:58,760","00:24:00,440","-was highly disrespectful.
-You're right. And--"
"468","cue","00:24:00,520","00:24:03,560","I felt sick
at some of the stuff that I heard,"
"469","cue","00:24:03,640","00:24:05,160","because I clearly like Al,"
"470","cue","00:24:05,240","00:24:09,280","and for you to interject
and have a laugh about it, it's not--"
"471","cue","00:24:09,360","00:24:10,640","-[Austen] It wasn't at you.
-[Al] Nah, Jess."
"472","cue","00:24:10,720","00:24:12,560","I don't care.
I don't do that to you chats."
"473","cue","00:24:12,640","00:24:15,280","I'm going 'cause you're gonna be
in big trouble, bruv."
"474","cue","00:24:15,360","00:24:17,240","As if I want to hear from them."
"475","cue","00:24:17,320","00:24:21,120","Like, I think those boys should focus on
their relationship than butting into mine."
"476","cue","00:24:21,200","00:24:22,760","[Al] Nah, I just said,"
"477","cue","00:24:22,840","00:24:25,280","""Things like this is always gonna happen

-But it's not about that."
"480","cue","00:24:27,480","00:24:30,480","It's-- One of you guys

"481","cue","00:24:31,920","00:24:32,920","[Austen] I think, um…"
"482","cue","00:24:34,280","00:24:35,880","[Al]
I think things get-- Like I said to Jess,"
"483","cue","00:24:35,960","00:24:38,200","I think things can get misinterpreted
and twisted."
"484","cue","00:24:38,280","00:24:39,120","[Austen] Yeah."
"485","cue","00:24:39,200","00:24:41,080","-It's gonna be Chinese whispers nonstop.

"492","cue","00:24:53,080","00:24:57,520","All it takes is two, three people down the
link and the story is completely twisted."
"493","cue","00:24:57,600","00:25:00,440","That's the thing as well. You have to also
understand you don't know the situation,"
"494","cue","00:25:00,520","00:25:02,400","so you can't blow up straightaway at Al."
"495","cue","00:25:02,480","00:25:04,320","I think it's important
to talk to him first--"

you guys are making me out to be a psycho."

absolutely neutral so that no one knows."

""Wow, blew my socks off,"" something."
"785","cue","00:36:42,040","00:36:43,960","-But as well, his personality?
-[Madeline] Personality is key."
"786","cue","00:36:44,040","00:36:47,120","It just knocked him, like,
knocked him up a thousand pegs."
"787","cue","00:36:47,640","00:36:50,480","I feel like it's a good thing
they don't know we're twins as well"
"788","cue","00:36:50,560","00:36:52,840","'cause I feel like
if they had clued on to it,"
"789","cue","00:36:52,920","00:36:56,040","maybe they wouldn't have been
as transparent, knowing I'm his twin."
"790","cue","00:36:56,120","00:36:59,160","So I feel like it's good that I'm getting
the raw sort of feedback."

-Okay. [chuckles] Give us the lowdown."

"793","cue","00:37:04,720","00:37:08,920","So, Tina is-- She likes your vibe."
"794","cue","00:37:09,000","00:37:12,160","She said you had a really great
personality when you walked in and stuff."
"795","cue","00:37:12,240","00:37:14,160","She was like, yeah,
you're really energetic. Yeah."
"796","cue","00:37:14,240","00:37:18,360","And then Stella said that she really liked
your personality as well,"

cheeky, very confident, stuff like that."

you're quite confident."
"799","cue","00:37:23,800","00:37:26,320","Having my own twin here
as, like, a little secret agent,"
"800","cue","00:37:26,400","00:37:29,560","it definitely gives me a little advantage
'cause she's friends with the girls."
"801","cue","00:37:29,640","00:37:31,320","So, yeah, it's good."
"802","cue","00:37:31,400","00:37:35,040","Can you go, like,
maybe talk to Mitch and Callum"
"803","cue","00:37:35,120","00:37:39,200","and see, like, you know-- Just bring up,
""What do you reckon with the new chick?"""

I need some more information."
"806","cue","00:37:43,720","00:37:45,400","You're not working hard enough."

"808","cue","00:37:47,160","00:37:48,920","-[Callum] Not much, bro.

-[Mitch] I think she's fucking banging."
"813","cue","00:37:55,080","00:37:57,800","To be fair, when I came in,
I said I was into blondes as well."
"814","cue","00:37:57,880","00:38:00,240","That's my track record.
So, attractive girl."
"815","cue","00:38:00,320","00:38:02,800","I had a chat with her,
and the chat was really good, flowed well."
"816","cue","00:38:02,880","00:38:04,560","Good banter, had a cheeky little flirt…"

they're gonna crack on with my sister."
"828","cue","00:38:27,720","00:38:28,960","That was awkward and hard."
"829","cue","00:38:29,040","00:38:31,520","Like, I'm a super overprotective brother."
"830","cue","00:38:31,600","00:38:34,560","In the normal world, if someone's
chewing out my sister or saying she's hot,"
"831","cue","00:38:34,640","00:38:36,360","I'm like-- I'll shut it down straightaway."
"832","cue","00:38:36,440","00:38:38,760","So, to be sitting there and egging it on"
"833","cue","00:38:38,840","00:38:41,680","and handshaking 'em and slapping 'em
about how hot my sister is,"
"834","cue","00:38:41,760","00:38:44,760","I was low-key thinking… [groans]"
"835","cue","00:38:44,840","00:38:46,520","-Do you wanna piggyback me down here?
-Yeah."
"836","cue","00:38:46,600","00:38:49,040","-My back's gonna be sweaty though.
-[Madeline] Don't have any shoes. [groans]"
"837","cue","00:38:49,120","00:38:50,760","[Callum] Mads asked for a piggyback."
"838","cue","00:38:50,840","00:38:53,280","And I was like,
""Just jump straight on your horse, babe."""
"839","cue","00:38:53,360","00:38:56,040","-There's you. We've arrived.
-Thanks. This is service."
"840","cue","00:38:56,120","00:38:59,720","Callum has a very good-looking body.
I'll just leave it at that."
"841","cue","00:38:59,800","00:39:01,520","I was actually--
Now that I'm looking back,"
"842","cue","00:39:01,600","00:39:03,880","I reckon I was pretty nervous
when you walked out."
"843","cue","00:39:03,960","00:39:06,680","Were you? I think I got
a little bit nervous too, to be honest."
"844","cue","00:39:06,760","00:39:08,560","-I think you were blushing.
-I don't know-- Yeah."
"845","cue","00:39:08,640","00:39:11,080","-I don't usually-- [chuckles]
-A little bit giddy."
"846","cue","00:39:11,160","00:39:14,120","I'm not usually like that,
but I was this morning. I don't know why."
"847","cue","00:39:14,200","00:39:16,440","It's a nice surprise to see
somebody come in that's like--"
"848","cue","00:39:16,520","00:39:18,680","-Fresh face. Yeah.
-Yeah, it's a nice feeling."
"849","cue","00:39:18,760","00:39:22,080","-Saved the best to last.
-Oh. Stop it. Love that."
"850","cue","00:39:22,160","00:39:24,640","That Madeline bird is
what I mean by Astroturf."
"851","cue","00:39:24,720","00:39:26,240","She is perfect."
"852","cue","00:39:26,320","00:39:28,480","Yeah, I definitely feel like
I vibed with you the most."
"853","cue","00:39:28,560","00:39:29,400","-Oh, really?
-Yeah."
"854","cue","00:39:29,480","00:39:32,160","-You're fueling my ego.
-I've had chats-- Oh, stop it."
"855","cue","00:39:32,240","00:39:33,840","My ego's big enough as it is.
I can't go any bigger."
"856","cue","00:39:33,920","00:39:36,320","-Really? Aah. Um.
-No, I'm joking."
"857","cue","00:39:36,400","00:39:38,440","-I feel there's a but coming. [scoffs]
-Like there's a what?"
"858","cue","00:39:38,520","00:39:39,720","-A but coming.
-A bat?"
"859","cue","00:39:39,800","00:39:42,680","-A but. B-U-T. Like ""but.""
-A bu--"
"860","cue","00:39:42,760","00:39:45,960","-A but. I'm sorry. [chuckling]
-Yeah, not a fucking bat."
"861","cue","00:39:46,040","00:39:48,200","Callum, he speaks so fast,
and the accent--"
"862","cue","00:39:48,280","00:39:50,040","I feel like I can barely understand him."
"863","cue","00:39:50,120","00:39:52,200","But yeah, it's hot. So it's fine."
"864","cue","00:39:52,280","00:39:54,720","-Do you have any brothers or sisters?
-Mmm."
"865","cue","00:39:54,800","00:39:56,360","I have quite a big family."
"866","cue","00:39:56,440","00:39:57,960","There's a lot of us, there's seven of us."
"867","cue","00:39:58,040","00:39:59,760","-[stammers] Brothers and sisters?
-Seven."
"868","cue","00:39:59,840","00:40:01,840","-Yeah, there's too many to keep track of.
-Fuck. Okay."
"869","cue","00:40:01,920","00:40:04,400","Five sisters, two brothers."
"870","cue","00:40:04,480","00:40:08,640","I was trying to be very vague
when Callum was asking me about my family."
"871","cue","00:40:08,720","00:40:10,680","My sisters, year older than me"
"872","cue","00:40:10,760","00:40:12,000","then another one, two years older than me."
"873","cue","00:40:12,080","00:40:15,160","Oh, my God. Your house must be
like <i>Cheaper by the Dozen</i>."
"874","cue","00:40:15,240","00:40:16,720","Um. Yeah."
"875","cue","00:40:16,800","00:40:19,040","I sort of just tried to dodge it
because I was like,"
"876","cue","00:40:19,120","00:40:20,920","""I don't want to blow my cover.""
[chuckles]"
"877","cue","00:40:21,000","00:40:23,680","One, two, three. [strains, chuckles]"
"878","cue","00:40:23,760","00:40:25,840","-Am I heavy? Am I heavy?
-[Callum] Nah. No way."
"879","cue","00:40:26,840","00:40:28,120","-[Madeline] Now it's fine.
-[Callum] Is it hot?"
"880","cue","00:40:28,200","00:40:29,560","Do you reckon you can bench press me?"
"881","cue","00:40:29,640","00:40:31,120","-Do it.
-I'll bench press you."
"882","cue","00:40:31,200","00:40:32,320","-Really?
-Yeah, do you wanna try?"
"883","cue","00:40:32,400","00:40:33,320","-Yeah.
-Okay."
"884","cue","00:40:33,400","00:40:36,120","Look at his muscles.
I was like, I have to put it to the test."
"885","cue","00:40:36,200","00:40:38,400","-What do I get?
-[Madeline groans]"
"886","cue","00:40:38,480","00:40:40,040","What do I get? What's my reward?"
"887","cue","00:40:40,720","00:40:42,960","-What's your reward?
-Yeah, what's my reward?"
"888","cue","00:40:43,040","00:40:44,280","[Madeline] Hmm."
"889","cue","00:40:44,360","00:40:46,080","-A peck?
-You can get a peck."
"890","cue","00:40:46,160","00:40:48,800","-Can I?
-Yeah. That's if you can do it."
"891","cue","00:40:48,880","00:40:49,880","Okay."
"892","cue","00:40:49,960","00:40:51,320","All right, so how are we doing this?"
"893","cue","00:40:51,400","00:40:53,240","I don't know, I've never
bench pressed a girl before."
"894","cue","00:40:53,840","00:40:56,160","-Okay. You gotta roll back.
-Watch your hands, boy."
"895","cue","00:40:56,240","00:40:58,640","My hands have gotta go there. I'm sorry
but my hands are gonna touch your ass."
"896","cue","00:40:58,720","00:41:02,640","-I'm going to roll back. Okay. [chuckles]
-Roll back. Don't fart on me."
"897","cue","00:41:02,720","00:41:03,680","-Come on.
-Okay."
"898","cue","00:41:03,760","00:41:07,200","-Wait, wait, wait. [strains]
-Legs up. Legs up."
"899","cue","00:41:07,280","00:41:09,920","-[Madeline shouts]
-Oh, fuck. Wait, wait, wait."
"900","cue","00:41:14,360","00:41:17,200","-That's one kiss, that's two kiss.
-Okay, do five. No, do five."
"901","cue","00:41:17,280","00:41:19,800","-[chuckles]
-That's three kiss. That's four kiss."
"902","cue","00:41:19,880","00:41:22,800","-That's f-- Aw!
-One more. One more. One more."
"903","cue","00:41:22,880","00:41:24,440","[both chuckle]"
"904","cue","00:41:24,520","00:41:26,920","I would say I'm impressed
with Callum's muscles."
"905","cue","00:41:27,000","00:41:28,000","Yes."
"906","cue","00:41:28,080","00:41:30,160","-Five. Best of five.
-Deal's a deal."
"907","cue","00:41:30,240","00:41:31,560","-[kisses]
-[Madeline chuckles]"
"908","cue","00:41:31,640","00:41:33,040","Oh, not bad. Not bad."
"909","cue","00:41:33,120","00:41:36,480","I wanted to press her
so I can show off my strong side."
"910","cue","00:41:36,560","00:41:39,120","But I finished with the kiss
to just show her my soft side."
"911","cue","00:41:39,200","00:41:40,920","Good balance, innit?
It's like a yin and a yang."
"912","cue","00:41:58,200","00:42:01,000","[narrator] <i>After all the secret twin</i>
<i>bombshell business,</i>"
"913","cue","00:42:01,080","00:42:04,320","<i>we need a little update</i>

-I don't know. I didn't notice them, bro."
"922","cue","00:42:21,400","00:42:23,080","-[Austen chuckles]
-It was like a swarm."
"923","cue","00:42:23,160","00:42:24,280","[Austen] Fucking hell."
"924","cue","00:42:24,360","00:42:25,560","Are you gonna be okay?"
"925","cue","00:42:27,240","00:42:28,640","Yeah. I think."
"926","cue","00:42:30,160","00:42:31,840","I found what I wanna say."
"927","cue","00:42:35,280","00:42:37,560","You look like
I've sucked the life out of you."
"928","cue","00:42:38,120","00:42:39,920","-Yeah.
-So…"
"929","cue","00:42:40,000","00:42:42,560","[inhales deeply]
…here's where I'm coming from,"
"930","cue","00:42:42,640","00:42:45,360","I feel like I'm at the point
where I am closed off"
"931","cue","00:42:45,440","00:42:49,320","from getting to know people
because I'm so sold on you."
"932","cue","00:42:49,400","00:42:51,040","I guess when you say to a girl"
"933","cue","00:42:51,120","00:42:53,160","that I'm open to getting to know people,"
"934","cue","00:42:53,240","00:42:56,800","I'm taking it as, ""Okay.
Well, Al obviously still wants to test"
"935","cue","00:42:56,880","00:42:59,680","if he's got better connections
with someone else over me."""
"936","cue","00:42:59,760","00:43:01,720","Getting to know them or be able to talk?"
"937","cue","00:43:01,800","00:43:03,080","'Cause that's a fine line."
"938","cue","00:43:03,760","00:43:05,720","Well, see that's what's confusing."
"939","cue","00:43:05,800","00:43:09,480","Yeah, Jess and I have talked over and over
and it's driving me nuts."
"940","cue","00:43:10,120","00:43:12,120","What is open to talk to them mean?"
"941","cue","00:43:12,840","00:43:14,960","To see if you have a connection with them."
"942","cue","00:43:15,040","00:43:18,040","It's to test to see whether you
have a connection with them."
"943","cue","00:43:18,120","00:43:20,360","[Al] I don't even know
what the fight's about now."
"944","cue","00:43:20,440","00:43:23,440","I feel like she's just
making a fuss over nothing."
"945","cue","00:43:23,520","00:43:25,840","I just feel like I'm at that point where
I feel like,"
"946","cue","00:43:25,920","00:43:27,600","I like you more than you like me,"
"947","cue","00:43:28,400","00:43:30,560","or I'm sold on you
more than you're sold on me."
"948","cue","00:43:30,640","00:43:32,400","Which makes me feel very vulnerable."
"949","cue","00:43:33,320","00:43:35,200","And to be fair, it makes me feel a bit sad"
"950","cue","00:43:35,280","00:43:37,160","'cause I thought we were on the same page."
"951","cue","00:43:39,120","00:43:40,960","I don't know anymore, Jess.
My brain hurts."
"952","cue","00:43:44,560","00:43:46,840","All right.
Well then, I'll leave you be then."
"953","cue","00:43:46,920","00:43:50,560","If I suck the life out of you
then maybe I'm not good for you."
"954","cue","00:43:53,480","00:43:54,920","All I wanted to hear in that moment"
"955","cue","00:43:55,000","00:43:58,400","is that he likes me
just as much as I like him."
"956","cue","00:43:58,480","00:44:00,520","And for him to just say that,"
"957","cue","00:44:00,600","00:44:03,800","it literally felt like
he grabbed my heart and shattered it."
"958","cue","00:44:03,880","00:44:05,520","That's how it felt like."
"959","cue","00:44:05,600","00:44:07,360","Now I'm at the point
where I'm done with Al."
"960","cue","00:44:07,440","00:44:10,280","I don't really want to pursue someone
who doesn't really care about me."
"961","cue","00:44:12,480","00:44:15,320","To be fair, I actually want to leave.
I don't want to stay here anymore."
"962","cue","00:44:15,400","00:44:16,760","You're not leaving."
"963","cue","00:44:16,840","00:44:18,760","[Jess]
What am I staying here for then, Claudia?"
"964","cue","00:44:18,840","00:44:21,400","-I think you guys are just having a fight.
-I don't care."
"965","cue","00:44:22,160","00:44:23,560","-Jess--
-I don't want to be here."
"966","cue","00:44:23,640","00:44:26,120","Jess is that hardheaded"
"967","cue","00:44:26,200","00:44:28,960","that if she said she was going to leave,
she would leave."
"968","cue","00:44:29,040","00:44:31,360","I get angrier by the second."
"969","cue","00:44:31,440","00:44:32,320","Yeah, but--"
"970","cue","00:44:32,400","00:44:35,840","And now I'm at the point where
I don't want to get to know him anymore."
"971","cue","00:44:35,920","00:44:37,080","He can go fuck himself."
"972","cue","00:44:37,600","00:44:40,280","He means well,
the only thing-- his problem is"
"973","cue","00:44:40,360","00:44:41,960","that he just never been
in a relationship before."
"974","cue","00:44:42,040","00:44:44,240","No, the problem is
he doesn't understand commitment."
"975","cue","00:44:44,320","00:44:46,000","Because he's never been
a relationship before."
"976","cue","00:44:46,080","00:44:47,560","Well, I have no time for that."
"977","cue","00:44:47,640","00:44:49,120","I've been cheated on already two-- twice."
"978","cue","00:44:49,200","00:44:53,280","I'm not waiting for another immature guy
to do the same thing to me."
"979","cue","00:44:53,360","00:44:55,200","It's a no-brainer."
"980","cue","00:44:55,280","00:44:59,160","To be honest, I'm just scared that Al
is going to eventually hurt my feelings."
"981","cue","00:44:59,240","00:45:02,600","And I feel like he has the potential now
to break my heart."
"982","cue","00:45:02,680","00:45:04,120","That's how invested I am."
"983","cue","00:45:04,920","00:45:06,800","-Can we go talk to Al?
-[Jess] Yeah."
"984","cue","00:45:06,880","00:45:09,200","Do whatever you want.
But you can tell him I'm finished."
"985","cue","00:45:09,280","00:45:10,280","[Claudia] Okay."
"986","cue","00:45:11,160","00:45:14,880","I understand
why Jess is kind of angry for sure."
"987","cue","00:45:14,960","00:45:17,560","But I do think that Jess is acting
upon her emotions"
"988","cue","00:45:17,640","00:45:18,760","and that's very, very dangerous."
"989","cue","00:45:18,840","00:45:20,800","She said that she's gonna leave tonight."
"990","cue","00:45:20,880","00:45:22,200","-She said that?
-Yeah."
"991","cue","00:45:22,280","00:45:24,160","Is she really gonna give up that easy?"
"992","cue","00:45:24,240","00:45:26,440","When she sees red,
she doesn't care what she says."
