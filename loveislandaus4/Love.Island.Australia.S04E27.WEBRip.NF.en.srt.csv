"681","cue","00:34:12,000","00:34:15,000","you must go away
and consider the following."
"682","cue","00:34:16,840","00:34:19,239","Who is least likely"
"683","cue","00:34:20,920","00:34:24,719","to make it
as a couple outside of the villa?"

the couple with the most votes…"

"693","cue","00:35:25,680","00:35:28,480","At the end of the day,
you look at all the couples"
"694","cue","00:35:28,560","00:35:30,240","and everyone has a connection."
"695","cue","00:35:30,840","00:35:35,000","-It's really hard.
-And it's not like a weak connection."
"696","cue","00:35:35,080","00:35:37,200","Everyone's got quite
a strong connection now."
"697","cue","00:35:38,040","00:35:40,280","Is there any couple

"699","cue","00:35:44,520","00:35:46,200","Obviously everyone deserves to be here."
"700","cue","00:35:46,280","00:35:50,160","-Everyone does have a connection.
-Hmm. I agree."
"701","cue","00:35:50,240","00:35:53,120","Mitch and Tina,
if they haven't already started"
"702","cue","00:35:53,200","00:35:55,400","to feel like they're starting to
fall in love again"
"703","cue","00:35:55,480","00:35:58,720","in here when everything's fast-forwarded,
are they gonna do it when they're outside?"

"705","cue","00:36:02,360","00:36:05,960","-Callum and Mads, I feel like--

"706","cue","00:36:06,040","00:36:11,440","I don't really know
if they're looking for the same thing."
"707","cue","00:36:11,520","00:36:14,000","And then we have Al and Jess."
"708","cue","00:36:14,080","00:36:16,800","I feel like I'm still not really sold,
if I'm being honest."
"709","cue","00:36:16,880","00:36:18,160","-Really?
-I don't think--"
"710","cue","00:36:18,240","00:36:21,000","I'd probably question
if they would work on the outside."
"711","cue","00:36:25,000","00:36:27,520","This is so shit.
I love every single person here."
"712","cue","00:36:27,600","00:36:30,920","[sighs] Okay, Cal and Maddy?"
"713","cue","00:36:31,960","00:36:36,280","Do I think they would work on the outside?
I don't know. I really don't know."
"714","cue","00:36:36,360","00:36:38,600","We know what Callum has been like in here."
"715","cue","00:36:38,680","00:36:42,400","And I genuinely don't know if he's ready
to settle down with someone just yet."
"716","cue","00:36:42,480","00:36:44,560","[Claudia] Tina and Mitch."
"717","cue","00:36:45,440","00:36:46,920","Why open the same chapter…"
"718","cue","00:36:47,640","00:36:49,200","-That's so true.
-…and expect a different ending?"
"719","cue","00:36:49,280","00:36:51,760","But then,
are we cutting their journey too short?"
"720","cue","00:36:51,840","00:36:52,880","Yeah."
"721","cue","00:36:54,760","00:36:58,720","I do believe Callum and Maddy
are forming a genuine connection."
"722","cue","00:36:59,320","00:37:00,280","Uh, he--"
"723","cue","00:37:00,800","00:37:03,360","-I know he's your best mate.
-I know, but--"
"724","cue","00:37:03,440","00:37:07,120","But I don't know if they're going to work."
"725","cue","00:37:07,200","00:37:09,560","I honestly can't vote for them. I cannot."
"726","cue","00:37:10,120","00:37:13,160","I'd rather, like, leave
than say, ""Fuck them."""

"728","cue","00:37:15,560","00:37:17,160","It's not what it's about."
"729","cue","00:37:18,000","00:37:19,440","No, I couldn't."
"730","cue","00:37:20,440","00:37:22,480","You're genuinely
not thinking about the question."
"731","cue","00:37:22,560","00:37:25,560","But also,
he's going to leave eventually, so…"
"732","cue","00:37:25,640","00:37:30,520","-Well, I am--
-I think you're very, very, very biased."
"733","cue","00:37:30,600","00:37:32,120","[exhales]"

"736","cue","00:38:04,720","00:38:08,680","but the couple with the most votes
will be dumped tonight."
"737","cue","00:38:10,080","00:38:12,520","Mitch and Tina, please stand up."
"738","cue","00:38:15,640","00:38:17,760","Which couple do you believe"
"739","cue","00:38:17,840","00:38:20,760","is least likely to make it
on the outside world?"
"740","cue","00:38:21,400","00:38:23,720","I feel like obviously it was
a super hard decision tonight."
"741","cue","00:38:23,800","00:38:26,480","And I guess, yeah, one particular couple,"
"742","cue","00:38:26,560","00:38:28,360","we felt probably wasn't
as strong as the others."
"743","cue","00:38:28,440","00:38:30,760","Unfortunately,
they probably haven't had as much time"
"744","cue","00:38:30,840","00:38:32,400","as the other people, which is sad."
"745","cue","00:38:32,480","00:38:35,240","So tonight we are voting to dump…"
"746","cue","00:38:40,160","00:38:41,200","Callum and Mads."
"747","cue","00:38:42,840","00:38:43,960","[mouthing words] We're good."
"748","cue","00:38:45,520","00:38:47,680","Madeline and Callum, please stand up."

"750","cue","00:38:50,960","00:38:56,880","Which couple do you believe is least
likely to make it on the outside world?"
"751","cue","00:38:56,960","00:38:58,400","And why?"
"752","cue","00:38:59,040","00:39:02,760","Obviously we do believe that everyone
in here does have a solid connection."
"753","cue","00:39:02,840","00:39:05,080","We looked at it now very thoroughly."
"754","cue","00:39:05,160","00:39:09,400","And it was a super hard decision
and a really, really close call"
"755","cue","00:39:09,480","00:39:13,040","but the couple
that we are voting to dump is…"
"756","cue","00:39:16,640","00:39:17,840","Tina and Mitch."
"757","cue","00:39:21,840","00:39:23,520","Thanks, guys, you can sit down."
"758","cue","00:39:35,280","00:39:39,200","Jess and Al, which couple do you believe"
"759","cue","00:39:39,280","00:39:43,720","is least likely to make it
outside the villa and why?"
"760","cue","00:39:43,800","00:39:46,920","We do believe every couple here
have a very good chance of working."
"761","cue","00:39:47,000","00:39:50,240","But the factors that we do weigh up is,
you know, time in the villa,"
"762","cue","00:39:51,040","00:39:52,240","distance from each other,"
"763","cue","00:39:52,320","00:39:55,960","and observations from the way
they've been here in the villa as well."
"764","cue","00:39:56,560","00:40:00,080","We believe that there is a spark
in each and every couple,"
"765","cue","00:40:00,160","00:40:03,320","but we do have to make a decision."
"766","cue","00:40:03,400","00:40:06,280","So tonight, we are voting to dump…"
"767","cue","00:40:14,680","00:40:15,880","Callum and Mads."
"768","cue","00:40:24,440","00:40:29,080","That's two votes for Callum and Mads
and one vote for Tina and Mitch."
"769","cue","00:40:34,040","00:40:36,560","Phoebe and Mitchell, please stand up."
"770","cue","00:40:40,880","00:40:46,280","So, obviously I think this is the hardest
decision any of us have had to make."
"771","cue","00:40:46,360","00:40:50,520","The worst part about it is that
we can't really make judgments"
"772","cue","00:40:50,600","00:40:52,320","of how time is in the villa."
"773","cue","00:40:52,400","00:40:54,600","We have to really think
about the outside life"
"774","cue","00:40:54,680","00:40:58,920","and just anything that reality
can really throw your way."
"775","cue","00:40:59,520","00:41:03,880","We also took into consideration
the chats we've had with each couple."
"776","cue","00:41:05,000","00:41:07,720","I feel like every couple, except for one,"
"777","cue","00:41:07,800","00:41:10,320","talked about the outside world
quite a lot."
"778","cue","00:41:10,400","00:41:12,600","And so, kind of just based on that,"
"779","cue","00:41:12,680","00:41:16,520","the couple we've decided
to dump tonight is…"
"780","cue","00:41:21,760","00:41:24,440","Tina and Mitch. Sorry, guys."
"781","cue","00:41:29,240","00:41:34,360","Two votes for Madeline and Callum
and two votes for Tina and Mitch."
"782","cue","00:41:38,600","00:41:42,800","Who stays and who goes tonight
will be decided by the next vote."
"783","cue","00:41:46,040","00:41:48,720","Claudia and Austen, please stand up."
"784","cue","00:41:54,600","00:41:56,080","[Claudia] This is not a nice feeling."
"785","cue","00:41:56,160","00:41:59,240","The worst thing, I think,
is that we had to think"
"786","cue","00:41:59,320","00:42:04,240","not about who we're friends with
but who would really work on the outside."
"787","cue","00:42:05,360","00:42:08,680","Putting aside the, I guess,
friendships that we've all had in here"
"788","cue","00:42:08,760","00:42:12,200","and just purely seeing
who will work on the outside,"
"789","cue","00:42:12,280","00:42:16,200","we've come to the conclusion that,
you know, on both sides,"
"790","cue","00:42:16,840","00:42:19,960","it just, um--
I just don't feel like it's as strong"
"791","cue","00:42:20,040","00:42:21,920","as what most of the other couples are."
"792","cue","00:42:22,960","00:42:27,880","From our perspective anyways,
maybe they're not ready just yet."
"793","cue","00:42:28,520","00:42:33,120","So, that being said,
and it pains me to say this…"
"794","cue","00:42:34,000","00:42:36,600","[""Falling Forever"" playing]"
"795","cue","00:42:50,400","00:42:53,280","The couple we are voting to dump is…"

"797","cue","00:43:04,600","00:43:05,440","What?"
"798","cue","00:43:07,880","00:43:09,240","[Sophie] Thanks, guys."
"799","cue","00:43:14,400","00:43:16,480","-Tina and Mitch, come up here.
-[chuckles]"

-[sniffs]"
"801","cue","00:43:20,640","00:43:22,160","[Claudia whispers] I feel stupid."
"802","cue","00:43:23,320","00:43:24,920","[Mitch] Feels weird being dumped."
"803","cue","00:43:25,000","00:43:26,440","-[chuckles]
-[Sophie] Yeah. I know, right?"
"804","cue","00:43:26,520","00:43:29,920","-Now I've got the full experience now.
-[chuckles] This is the first time."
"805","cue","00:43:30,000","00:43:31,280","-[Sophie] Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah."
"806","cue","00:43:31,360","00:43:32,600","How you guys feeling?"
"807","cue","00:43:32,680","00:43:36,640","Like, I'm happy that we've, kind of,
found each other again in it,"
"808","cue","00:43:36,720","00:43:40,240","and I'm really happy that all the couples
here get to experience"
"809","cue","00:43:40,320","00:43:43,080","-because I know what that's like.
-We've lived this. We have won it."
"810","cue","00:43:43,160","00:43:46,720","So I mean,
it would be nice to go back-to-back."
"811","cue","00:43:46,800","00:43:48,640","-[laughing]
-Could do with 25K."
"812","cue","00:43:49,840","00:43:52,160","But honestly, you guys are amazing people."
"813","cue","00:43:52,240","00:43:54,720","-We're happy for you all. We love you.
-That's so sweet."
"814","cue","00:43:54,800","00:43:57,560","-We love you guys.
-We love you."
"815","cue","00:43:57,640","00:43:59,760","I'm crying. But, like, I'm happy."
"816","cue","00:43:59,840","00:44:02,360","-Like, it's hard to leave, but, like…
-Yeah."
"817","cue","00:44:02,440","00:44:05,800","…I'm so grateful to have met you guys
and, like, to be part of your journey."
"818","cue","00:44:05,880","00:44:07,920","But, like, I'm actually really happy."
"819","cue","00:44:09,200","00:44:10,840","-I'm just happy you're back together.
-Yeah."
"820","cue","00:44:10,920","00:44:13,440","I think there'll be a lot of people
out in the outside world"
"821","cue","00:44:13,520","00:44:16,960","stoked you're back together as well. Yeah."
"822","cue","00:44:19,840","00:44:24,240","Okay, Tina and Mitch,
you have 30 minutes to say your goodbyes,"
"823","cue","00:44:25,080","00:44:27,280","and then it'll be time to leave the villa."
"824","cue","00:44:27,360","00:44:30,160","And the rest of you, congratulations.
Well done."
"825","cue","00:44:30,240","00:44:31,920","And I'll see you again very, very soon."

to send your friends home,"
"832","cue","00:44:52,560","00:44:55,520","'cause everyone in here
just deserves love,"
"833","cue","00:44:55,600","00:44:58,720","and I want everyone to be happy
and to find that."

in <i>Love Island</i>, I think."

"840","cue","00:45:11,360","00:45:15,280","And you've given me competition.
I haven't had competition for 24 years."

that I even got to do, like--"

-Same."
"843","cue","00:45:22,160","00:45:25,080","I had the best--
Like, the time of my life twice,"
"844","cue","00:45:25,160","00:45:27,880","which I didn't think
would ever bloody happen."

"846","cue","00:45:33,520","00:45:35,840","-[Mitch] You all right?
-Yeah. How you feeling?"
"847","cue","00:45:35,920","00:45:37,800","Fine. I'm honestly fine."
"848","cue","00:45:39,760","00:45:40,800","{\an8}[chuckles]"
"849","cue","00:45:40,880","00:45:44,120","Yeah, I mean, it's obviously scary,
but I think we're in a good place."
"850","cue","00:45:44,200","00:45:46,920","So it's probably a good time
to get out there."
"851","cue","00:45:47,000","00:45:49,560","Yeah, I do believe me and Tina
can make it on the outside."
"852","cue","00:45:49,640","00:45:52,840","I think this time around me and Tina
know each other so much better."
"853","cue","00:45:52,920","00:45:56,840","So I feel like we're a lot more equipped
to take on the real-life challenges ahead."
"854","cue","00:45:57,680","00:45:58,720","I had the best time."
"855","cue","00:45:58,800","00:46:01,160","I can't even believe
we got to do this again."
"856","cue","00:46:01,240","00:46:02,280","I know, it's like--"
"857","cue","00:46:02,360","00:46:04,280","You have to be dumped
to do <i>Love Island</i>, don't you?"
"858","cue","00:46:04,360","00:46:06,840","-You can't just win.
-I've been an OG. I've been a bomb."
"859","cue","00:46:06,920","00:46:09,480","I've won. I've been dumped."
"860","cue","00:46:09,560","00:46:11,840","I've done it all.
There's nothing more I could do here."
"861","cue","00:46:11,920","00:46:14,000","I've ended up with you twice,"
"862","cue","00:46:14,080","00:46:18,480","so that surely counts for something."
"863","cue","00:46:18,560","00:46:22,480","-Yeah. True.
-[chuckles] Or I'm crazy."
"864","cue","00:46:22,560","00:46:27,480","Honestly, when I first saw him in here,
I was like, ""This could go really badly."""
"865","cue","00:46:27,560","00:46:29,800","But to be leaving together--"
"866","cue","00:46:29,880","00:46:32,760","You know, we started pretty much
our <i>Love Island</i> journey together"
"867","cue","00:46:32,840","00:46:34,120","the first time around,"
"868","cue","00:46:34,200","00:46:37,840","and to end it together
feels like such a high to leave."
"869","cue","00:46:37,920","00:46:41,440","I'm genuinely excited
to take on this new chapter with Mitch"
"870","cue","00:46:41,520","00:46:43,480","and see what it has for both of us."
"871","cue","00:46:44,000","00:46:47,080","I'm so excited
because I know what lies ahead,"
"872","cue","00:46:47,160","00:46:50,280","and you guys are gonna have
the best time ever."
"873","cue","00:46:50,360","00:46:52,160","-I guess the king and queen are out.
-[Tina] Shut up."
"874","cue","00:46:52,240","00:46:54,280","But who's gonna be the new king and queen?"
"875","cue","00:46:54,360","00:46:56,400","-[Mitch chuckling]
-Hand it over."
"876","cue","00:46:56,480","00:46:58,160","-[Mitch] Good luck, everyone.
-[Madeline] Bye, guys."
"877","cue","00:46:58,240","00:47:00,120","-[Tina] Bye.
-[contestants] Bye."
"878","cue","00:47:00,200","00:47:01,800","[cheering]"
"879","cue","00:47:04,880","00:47:07,760","[Tina] I would have loved
to have another night in the villa."
"880","cue","00:47:07,840","00:47:12,000","This place is absolutely magic,
but it did feel like it was our time."
"881","cue","00:47:12,080","00:47:14,160","[Mitch] We've already shown
that we can make it work in the villa,"
"882","cue","00:47:14,240","00:47:17,360","so now it's time to show that we can
make it work in the outside world."
"883","cue","00:47:17,440","00:47:19,280","We're excited, but I guess we're realistic"
"884","cue","00:47:19,360","00:47:21,120","and know that
challenges are gonna come our way"
"885","cue","00:47:21,200","00:47:22,760","and we're ready to take them on."
"886","cue","00:47:23,360","00:47:26,840","[Tina] There's no risk better
than risking something for love."
