"342","cue","00:18:13,920","00:18:17,200","What's your immediate type,
like, looks-wise?"
"343","cue","00:18:17,280","00:18:21,720","-Um, I would say my history is blonde.
-Damn it."
"344","cue","00:18:21,800","00:18:26,040","But, if I was to describe my type,
it would be dark hair, light eyes, tan."
"345","cue","00:18:26,120","00:18:27,800","-You guys are all tan.
-[chuckles]"
"346","cue","00:18:27,880","00:18:32,160","What's your major red flag
that would switch you off?"
"347","cue","00:18:32,240","00:18:34,480","-Do you have an accent too? [laughs]
-I sure do."
"348","cue","00:18:35,080","00:18:37,360","You aren't the only one
with an accent, babes."
"349","cue","00:18:37,440","00:18:40,360","[Mitchell] I think just rude.
If I'm out at dinner with someone"
"350","cue","00:18:40,440","00:18:43,600","and they don't thank the waitress
or waiter, that's a big red flag."
"351","cue","00:18:43,680","00:18:45,160","Like, um…"
"352","cue","00:18:45,240","00:18:46,600","Yeah, honestly. Or, like--"
"353","cue","00:18:46,680","00:18:49,360","Someone that doesn't get along
with my family or friends."
"354","cue","00:18:49,440","00:18:51,160","They're my family and friends
for a reason."
"355","cue","00:18:51,240","00:18:53,240","-Oh, my God. He's ticking the right boxes.
-[Phoebe laughs]"
"356","cue","00:18:53,320","00:18:55,240","[Sophie] Mitchell,
there's a lot of nodding going on."
"357","cue","00:18:55,320","00:18:57,320","-That was really sweet.
-[Claudia] That was sweet."
"358","cue","00:18:57,400","00:18:58,800","-[Layla] Aw.
-[chuckles]"
"359","cue","00:18:59,720","00:19:02,040","Okay, Mitchell,
we're gonna let you off the hook now."
"360","cue","00:19:02,640","00:19:06,320","You will get to couple up
with one of these amazing girls soon."
"361","cue","00:19:06,400","00:19:07,840","-Sick.
-But for now,"
"362","cue","00:19:07,920","00:19:11,360","why don't you just grab a seat
on the daybed and crack yourself a beer?"
"363","cue","00:19:11,440","00:19:14,120","Amazing. It's Kereru. Sick."
"364","cue","00:19:14,960","00:19:16,680","-Sweet. Cheers.
-[Phoebe] Oh, my God."
"365","cue","00:19:16,760","00:19:17,920","Sit back and relax."
"366","cue","00:19:18,000","00:19:19,720","[Mitchell] Amazing. I get to watch."
"367","cue","00:19:19,800","00:19:21,720","I was shitting myself going first."
"368","cue","00:19:21,800","00:19:24,400","This is going to be hard.
I'm also an impulse buyer."
"369","cue","00:19:24,480","00:19:27,320","I'm not an impulse buyer.
I'm a serial sampler."
"370","cue","00:19:27,400","00:19:29,960","-[Holly, Phoebe laughing]
-[narrator] <i>Soph, can you confirm?</i>"
"371","cue","00:19:30,040","00:19:32,280","Okay, girls,
who wants to meet another boy?"
"372","cue","00:19:32,360","00:19:34,200","-[all] Yes.
-[Holly] Whoo!"
"373","cue","00:19:34,280","00:19:35,720","[laughs]"
"374","cue","00:19:35,800","00:19:38,040","This is Andre."
"375","cue","00:19:38,120","00:19:40,240","-Ooh, Andre.
-[trills]"
"376","cue","00:19:43,040","00:19:45,760","-Oh!
-[Layla] Whoo, okay, hi."
"377","cue","00:19:45,840","00:19:47,120","-Okay. All right.
-Hello."
"378","cue","00:19:51,920","00:19:55,960","I'm Andre. I'm 24. I'm from Perth,
and I'm a psychology graduate."
"379","cue","00:20:01,920","00:20:03,720","I feel like my psychology degree
has definitely"
"380","cue","00:20:03,800","00:20:05,400","given me the tools
to be able to read women."
"381","cue","00:20:05,480","00:20:08,440","They shuffle closer to you
so they can get into eye contact."
"382","cue","00:20:08,520","00:20:10,800","I definitely know
when a girl is into me or not."
"383","cue","00:20:12,800","00:20:16,400","Looks-wise, I rate myself 8.73 recurring."
"384","cue","00:20:17,000","00:20:18,080","[chuckles]"
"385","cue","00:20:20,760","00:20:22,960","One night I was out
making eye contact with a girl."
"386","cue","00:20:23,040","00:20:24,480","So I thought, you know, ""I want her."""
"387","cue","00:20:24,560","00:20:28,120","She came up to me and just wanted
to tell me that I look like Pocahontas."
"388","cue","00:20:28,200","00:20:32,280","I went and googled who Pocahontas was.
She's so hot. Are you serious?"
"389","cue","00:20:32,360","00:20:35,320","If I was a dude,
I'd be chasing Pocahontas. [laughs]"
"390","cue","00:20:42,000","00:20:44,000","-How we going?
-Good."
"391","cue","00:20:44,080","00:20:46,360","-[Layla] How are you?
-[all laughing]"
"392","cue","00:20:46,440","00:20:48,000","Oh, my God. He is cute, too."
"393","cue","00:20:48,080","00:20:49,880","Excited to get in here
and finally meet everyone."
"394","cue","00:20:49,960","00:20:52,640","-You all look very nice by the way.
-Thank you."
"395","cue","00:20:52,720","00:20:54,440","[Sophie] Who's got a question for Andre?"
"396","cue","00:20:56,200","00:20:57,200","I've got one."
"397","cue","00:20:57,280","00:20:59,560","So if you were gonna
really impress a girl,"
"398","cue","00:20:59,640","00:21:01,680","what would you do
on the first date with her?"
"399","cue","00:21:01,760","00:21:06,600","I already have a date lined up that I take
only girlfriend material sort of women on."
"400","cue","00:21:06,680","00:21:07,560","Starts with dinner."
"401","cue","00:21:07,640","00:21:10,320","We used to play at a footie club
where you can go up the scoreboard,"
"402","cue","00:21:10,400","00:21:13,080","climb and overlook Fremantle,
which is a sea in Perth."
"403","cue","00:21:13,160","00:21:16,720","Have dinner overlooking Freo.
Nice beach. Nice lights. Nice scenery."
"404","cue","00:21:16,800","00:21:18,160","And, yeah, that's a date."
"405","cue","00:21:18,240","00:21:20,040","-He's got a full plan.
-Cute."
"406","cue","00:21:20,120","00:21:21,760","-Yeah.
-[Phoebe] I like that."
"407","cue","00:21:22,920","00:21:26,000","As you probably realize, we're doing
things a little differently this year."
"408","cue","00:21:26,080","00:21:28,360","-Yeah.
-You will get to couple up"
"409","cue","00:21:28,440","00:21:30,320","-with one of these girls soon.
-Sounds good."
"410","cue","00:21:30,400","00:21:34,840","But for now, just go chill next to
Mitchell on the daybed and grab a beer."
"411","cue","00:21:34,920","00:21:36,080","Thanks for having me. Cheers."
"412","cue","00:21:36,160","00:21:38,360","-Thank you. Nice to meet you.
-[Mitchell] Nice to meet you."
"413","cue","00:21:41,360","00:21:43,800","Okay, girls, are we happy
with the first two boys?"
"414","cue","00:21:43,880","00:21:44,880","-Yes.
-Yeah, thank you."
"415","cue","00:21:46,000","00:21:47,880","You want to meet another one, don't you?"
"416","cue","00:21:47,960","00:21:49,800","-Yes.
-Yeah."
"417","cue","00:21:49,880","00:21:51,120","[giggling]"
"418","cue","00:21:51,200","00:21:53,640","Okay, well, this is Conor."
"419","cue","00:21:53,720","00:21:55,480","-Whoo!
-Whoo!"
"420","cue","00:21:59,280","00:22:00,520","-Ooh.
-[Layla] Ooh."
"421","cue","00:22:00,600","00:22:02,400","I just saw a big tattoo."
"422","cue","00:22:03,640","00:22:06,280","-He's hot. Like he would throw you around.
-Yeah."
"423","cue","00:22:06,360","00:22:07,520","I'm sorry. [chuckles]"
"424","cue","00:22:12,480","00:22:15,600","I'm Conor. I'm 26. I'm from Maroubra,
and I'm a real estate agent."
"425","cue","00:22:20,080","00:22:22,360","If I had to describe myself
in property terms,"
"426","cue","00:22:22,440","00:22:24,640","I'm a five-bedroom waterfront,
north-facing property"
"427","cue","00:22:24,720","00:22:25,800","in the heart of Sydney."
"428","cue","00:22:29,240","00:22:31,800","Being a real estate agent
is very similar to dating."
"429","cue","00:22:31,880","00:22:33,080","You're always selling yourself."
"430","cue","00:22:33,160","00:22:35,520","{\an8}It's called prospecting.
I'm pretty good at it."
"431","cue","00:22:39,520","00:22:42,000","When I walk into a room, the heads turn.
Look at me."
"432","cue","00:22:43,520","00:22:46,000","I don't compete with other people
'cause there's no competition with me."
"433","cue","00:22:49,240","00:22:50,400","I do like smaller women."
"434","cue","00:22:50,480","00:22:53,320","They have to be ambitious.
Obviously someone good-looking."
"435","cue","00:22:55,400","00:22:56,400","I'm an ass man as well."
"436","cue","00:22:58,000","00:23:00,640","I think I would slay in the villa.
I always win the game."
"437","cue","00:23:03,880","00:23:06,120","[Layla] Hey! [laughs]"
"438","cue","00:23:06,200","00:23:08,280","-See what I'm saying, girls?
-[Holly] Hello."
"439","cue","00:23:08,360","00:23:09,800","Welcome to <i>Love Island</i>, Conor."
"440","cue","00:23:09,880","00:23:11,800","Thank you very much. How are we all, good?"
"441","cue","00:23:11,880","00:23:12,960","[Islanders] Good."
"442","cue","00:23:13,040","00:23:15,360","Do you like the view?
And I'm not talking about Spain."
"443","cue","00:23:15,440","00:23:17,880","The girls here?
Yeah, they're pretty good to be honest."
"444","cue","00:23:17,960","00:23:20,920","-I'm pretty happy with it, yeah.
-He looks like my kind of red flag."
"445","cue","00:23:21,000","00:23:22,240","[laughs]"
"446","cue","00:23:22,320","00:23:23,640","He looks very mischievous."
"447","cue","00:23:23,720","00:23:25,800","[Sophie]
Are real estate agents mischievous?"
"448","cue","00:23:25,880","00:23:28,120","I think they are
because they know how to sell stuff."
"449","cue","00:23:28,200","00:23:29,280","-Okay.
-[Islanders] Ah!"
"450","cue","00:23:29,360","00:23:31,360","[Claudia] So, they're very smooth talkers."
"451","cue","00:23:31,440","00:23:33,920","Girls, who wants to ask Conor a question?"
"452","cue","00:23:34,000","00:23:35,840","-I've got one.
-I knew you had one."
"453","cue","00:23:35,920","00:23:37,360","[all laughing]"
"454","cue","00:23:37,440","00:23:40,560","Have you ever asked for a girl's number
while you're on the job?"
"455","cue","00:23:40,640","00:23:44,000","-Like if a girl comes in? You have?
-Yeah, it's-- Yeah, definitely."
"456","cue","00:23:44,080","00:23:45,840","-Okay.
-Thank you, Conor."
"457","cue","00:23:45,920","00:23:47,360","Go grab a beer and say hello."
"458","cue","00:23:47,440","00:23:48,800","-[Conor] You're the boys?
-What's up?"
"459","cue","00:23:48,880","00:23:51,080","-How are ya?
-I'm good, boys. What's going on?"
"460","cue","00:23:51,160","00:23:52,160","-Nice to meet ya.
-Cheers."
"461","cue","00:23:52,240","00:23:53,240","-Mad.
-[Mitchell] Grab a seat."
"462","cue","00:23:53,320","00:23:54,760","-Thank you, girls.
-[Mitchell chuckles]"
"463","cue","00:23:54,840","00:23:56,240","Who's next?"
"464","cue","00:23:56,320","00:23:58,840","Boy number four is Jordan."
"465","cue","00:24:02,560","00:24:03,760","-Ooh.
-Oh."
"466","cue","00:24:03,840","00:24:05,440","-He's got a mullet.
-[Layla] Is he wearing--"
"467","cue","00:24:05,520","00:24:07,440","-[laughing]
-[Holly] Oh, my God."
"468","cue","00:24:07,520","00:24:09,000","[Islanders laughing]"
"469","cue","00:24:09,080","00:24:13,560","-And he's in Speedos. [laughs]
-Aw. Budgies and a mullet, of course."
"470","cue","00:24:13,640","00:24:16,120","-Look at him go. Hello.
-Hi!"
"471","cue","00:24:16,200","00:24:17,480","[Islanders chuckle]"
"472","cue","00:24:17,560","00:24:19,760","He's actually a classic tradie boy."
"473","cue","00:24:19,840","00:24:21,240","[Sophie] How you going, Jordan?"
"474","cue","00:24:21,320","00:24:22,720","-Good. Pumped.
-[Sophie] Yeah?"
"475","cue","00:24:22,800","00:24:24,680","[rock music playing]"
"476","cue","00:24:25,680","00:24:29,800","Hey, I'm Jordan.
I'm 25 years old and I'm a sparky."
"477","cue","00:24:36,280","00:24:37,560","Tradies always get the ladies."
"478","cue","00:24:37,640","00:24:40,520","Every girl loves a guy
that's good with their hands"
"479","cue","00:24:40,600","00:24:45,760","and that can perform
inside and outside the house. [laughs]"
"480","cue","00:24:49,440","00:24:52,440","Dream <i>Love Island</i> date for me would be
overlooking the water,"
"481","cue","00:24:52,520","00:24:55,280","nice sunset and a hot Sheila,
and we'd get tapas."
"482","cue","00:24:56,000","00:24:58,440","Is that the small meals
that you get when you go out?"
"483","cue","00:25:02,280","00:25:04,640","In the villa,
I'll be chasing tail no matter what."
"484","cue","00:25:06,880","00:25:10,280","With the girls, as soon as I get
my cheekiness going, they're laughing."
"485","cue","00:25:10,360","00:25:11,880","Next minute, they're naked."
"486","cue","00:25:16,000","00:25:16,840","[laughs]"
"487","cue","00:25:16,920","00:25:18,560","-Love the budgies.
-[Jordan] Thank you."
"488","cue","00:25:18,640","00:25:20,720","[Sophie] There are eggplants on them.
I just realized."

and I like that."
"492","cue","00:25:27,320","00:25:29,560","-Yeah.
-I like good humor. Yeah."
"493","cue","00:25:29,640","00:25:32,880","-Don't like the mullet.
-But you can chop that off."
"494","cue","00:25:32,960","00:25:36,080","But it also says a lot about him.
Do you know what I mean?"
"495","cue","00:25:36,160","00:25:37,000","[Phoebe laughs]"
"496","cue","00:25:37,080","00:25:40,160","Jordan, you haven't said anything yet,
but you've already made an impression."

-[Islanders chuckle]"
"498","cue","00:25:42,680","00:25:45,000","-What do you think?
-Don't have any words to be honest."

"500","cue","00:25:46,680","00:25:49,880","Keen to, um, yeah, get to know them
and see what happens."

"506","cue","00:25:59,560","00:26:01,400","[Phoebe] He's like, ""Yes."""
"507","cue","00:26:01,480","00:26:04,800","Can I just ask you,
would you lose the mullet for love?"
"508","cue","00:26:04,880","00:26:06,640","[groans] That's a tough one."

-[Jess] Oh, my God."
"1181","cue","00:57:16,640","00:57:19,200","I was expecting it.
I usually do expect it. I usually get it."
"1182","cue","00:57:19,280","00:57:22,280","It was definitely a tease. It worked well
because I actually leaned in."
"1183","cue","00:57:23,520","00:57:28,240","Okay, Stella kiss the Islander
that you fancy the most."
"1184","cue","00:57:28,320","00:57:30,120","-[Phoebe] Ooh.
-Ooh."
"1185","cue","00:57:30,200","00:57:32,200","Yeah, go for it.
Don't worry about stepping on toes."
"1186","cue","00:57:32,280","00:57:33,720","There's no toes just yet."

"1192","cue","00:57:45,920","00:57:48,880","-I've got some fucking competition.
-[Holly] Yeah, you do. Yeah."
"1193","cue","00:57:48,960","00:57:51,160","Everyone,
they're fucking loving the mullet."
"1194","cue","00:57:51,240","00:57:53,560","-Why did no one step forward?
-[all laughing]"
"1195","cue","00:57:54,160","00:57:55,080","[Jordan] Fucking hell."
"1196","cue","00:57:55,680","00:57:58,840","I'm not gonna lie. It's a good feeling
from having no one step forward,"
"1197","cue","00:57:58,920","00:58:01,520","to having a few girls give you a kiss,"
"1198","cue","00:58:01,600","00:58:05,840","so I'd be lying if I said that it didn't
pump my tires up a bit. [chuckles]"
"1199","cue","00:58:05,920","00:58:08,320","Conor, kiss your favorite Islander."
"1200","cue","00:58:08,400","00:58:10,040","-Ooh.
-[Austen] Ooh."

"1205","cue","00:58:19,960","00:58:21,760","I didn't see that coming."

"1207","cue","00:58:25,720","00:58:27,040","-[Conor] That's good.
-Bam!"
"1208","cue","00:58:28,720","00:58:30,920","I feel like it struck a nerve a little bit"
"1209","cue","00:58:31,000","00:58:33,400","because Conor was my first option."
"1210","cue","00:58:33,480","00:58:38,880","I'm clearly not his.
So, yeah, that's a bit shit."
"1211","cue","00:58:45,400","00:58:47,000","-Hmm?
-No, I think it's not funny."
"1212","cue","00:58:47,080","00:58:48,320","Oh, really? Am I in trouble?"
"1213","cue","00:58:48,400","00:58:53,560","Throughout the day, I felt like I sensed
sort of, like, pink flags in Conor,"
"1214","cue","00:58:53,640","00:58:58,920","and then he kissed Claudia,
and then I was just like, yeah, red flags."
"1215","cue","00:58:59,000","00:59:01,600","I just thought I'd take you away
from the rest of the group…"
"1216","cue","00:59:01,680","00:59:02,640","[Conor] Mm-hmm."
"1217","cue","00:59:02,720","00:59:05,520","…'cause what you did in the Truth or Dare."
"1218","cue","00:59:05,600","00:59:06,600","It's day one."
"1219","cue","00:59:06,680","00:59:08,480","-We're not married or anything…
-Mm-hmm."
"1220","cue","00:59:08,560","00:59:12,120","-…but I'm actually here to find someone.
-Okay."
"1221","cue","00:59:12,200","00:59:18,280","And I genuinely wanna find a connection
and take that on the outside. So…"
"1222","cue","00:59:18,360","00:59:20,360","You want me to be on the same level?"
"1223","cue","00:59:20,440","00:59:23,400","-No. If you're not, that's fine.
-You're very fucking cute."
"1224","cue","00:59:23,480","00:59:25,280","I wanna keep you happy, to be honest."
"1225","cue","00:59:25,360","00:59:26,960","-No, I--
-I wanna keep you smiling."
"1226","cue","00:59:27,040","00:59:29,440","-I want you to be honest with me.
-I am being honest."
"1227","cue","00:59:29,520","00:59:31,560","If you have a better connection
with someone else,"
"1228","cue","00:59:31,640","00:59:34,640","-I want you to pursue someone else…
-But I don't."
"1229","cue","00:59:34,720","00:59:37,200","…if you don't feel anything to me,"
"1230","cue","00:59:37,280","00:59:39,280","because otherwise
that's called leading me on"
"1231","cue","00:59:39,360","00:59:42,760","and I do not respond well to being led on."
"1232","cue","00:59:42,840","00:59:45,080","-I understand.
-That really grinds my gears."
"1233","cue","00:59:45,160","00:59:47,880","I don't have a better connection
with anyone else other than you."
"1234","cue","00:59:47,960","00:59:49,280","Okay."
"1235","cue","00:59:49,360","00:59:53,120","I just want to know where I stand
and I want him to be honest about it."
"1236","cue","00:59:53,720","00:59:55,160","That was just a game."
"1237","cue","00:59:55,240","00:59:57,640","If I wanna pursue someone else,
I'll tell you first."
"1238","cue","00:59:57,720","01:00:00,280","-Okay.
-Can you forgive me for doing that?"
"1239","cue","01:00:00,360","01:00:03,160","And then give me a chance
to see where we go with this."
"1240","cue","01:00:03,680","01:00:05,360","All right, how about that?"
"1241","cue","01:00:05,440","01:00:06,880","-Okay.
-Promise?"
"1242","cue","01:00:06,960","01:00:07,880","Okay."
"1243","cue","01:00:07,960","01:00:11,080","The kiss with Claudia definitely made
Jess worry about my intentions."
"1244","cue","01:00:11,160","01:00:12,880","It ended up being a positive thing."
"1245","cue","01:00:12,960","01:00:16,600","I hope she sees it that way. If anything,
it's just put me closer to her."
"1246","cue","01:00:16,680","01:00:18,400","And now kiss me, please."
"1247","cue","01:00:19,080","01:00:20,360","I deserve it."
"1248","cue","01:00:24,840","01:00:26,640","You're a bit of a big baby, eh?"
"1249","cue","01:00:26,720","01:00:28,080","-[Jess] Why?
-[Conor] I love it."
"1250","cue","01:00:29,560","01:00:31,400","It turned me on heaps to be honest,"
"1251","cue","01:00:31,480","01:00:35,800","so props to her and props to me
'cause I'm pretty happy with it."
"1252","cue","01:00:48,960","01:00:50,520","What's gonna happen tonight?"
"1253","cue","01:00:50,600","01:00:54,840","[sighs] I want it to go slow with
all that sort of sexual stuff, you know?"
"1254","cue","01:00:54,920","01:00:57,040","-Yeah.
-But I'm gonna be horny."
"1255","cue","01:00:58,000","01:01:00,080","I'm feeling good
to share a bed with Austen."
"1256","cue","01:01:00,160","01:01:04,120","He's ticking a lot of my boxes
but I am a little nervous."
"1257","cue","01:01:04,200","01:01:07,440","If I get a bit horny,
I don't know how I'm gonna hold out."
"1258","cue","01:01:14,200","01:01:16,840","-Feel the power with them on? Put 'em on.
-No, I don't."
"1259","cue","01:01:16,920","01:01:19,280","I don't wanna put them on
so you're not disappointed."
"1260","cue","01:01:19,360","01:01:23,280","If he did go for a cuddle,
I think I'd give in. I love a cuddle."
"1261","cue","01:01:23,360","01:01:24,640","[gasps]"

-Mm-hmm."
"1264","cue","01:01:31,200","01:01:32,480","That's dope."
"1265","cue","01:01:32,560","01:01:34,800","With Stella, I do have a connection."
"1266","cue","01:01:34,880","01:01:38,040","There might be a bit of spooning,
um, maybe a bit of kissing"
"1267","cue","01:01:38,120","01:01:39,440","and then that might grow."
"1268","cue","01:01:39,960","01:01:42,040","-Like low-key.
-Are you a one- or two-pillow?"
"1269","cue","01:01:42,120","01:01:44,280","-It depends. Let me test.
-Depends on the pillow."
"1270","cue","01:01:44,800","01:01:47,040","Chemistry between me and Phoebe's great."
"1271","cue","01:01:47,120","01:01:48,200","Tonight in bed,"

then 100% I'm keen."
