holding back the last few days,"

Night, guys. See you in the morning."

"185","cue","00:10:28,880","00:10:32,680","I think I am starting to form a connection
with someone who really likes me."
"186","cue","00:10:32,760","00:10:35,280","So that's nice to go to bed
with that feeling."

something Austen would say."

communicate with me 100%."

in her belly from some of the comments"

a little bit in the doghouse."

about Austen?"

"712","cue","00:38:26,200","00:38:30,320","And I said, 'Because I think
it would get heated,' and then he left."

When I heard that, I just saw red,"

wanted to stay for the Truth or Dare"
"722","cue","00:38:57,720","00:39:00,200","and saying, you know,
he definitely wanted to stay,"
"723","cue","00:39:01,200","00:39:03,240","when I've heard something
completely different from Austen,"
"724","cue","00:39:03,320","00:39:05,640","is just like a bit of a stab in the back."

to look at me or touch me"

in that moment."

-Keep it there until the end of the game."

"731","cue","00:39:24,200","00:39:27,080","I left out of my own will.
I wanted to leave."
"732","cue","00:39:27,160","00:39:29,240","Pretty sure you didn't.
Pretty sure the quote said otherwise."

it's just my banter."

-[Madeline] We'll let it go. Truce?"

"758","cue","00:40:34,680","00:40:37,840","I'm happy to squash it for now,
but if anything else does come up,"

change my opinion of Jess."
"760","cue","00:40:40,600","00:40:41,920","-[Jess] Yeah.
-All good, babe."
"761","cue","00:40:42,000","00:40:43,880","-Oh, that's good.
-Let's move past it."
"762","cue","00:40:43,960","00:40:45,120","[Madeline] It's in the past."

I can tell you right now--"

-[Tina] What happened?"
"766","cue","00:40:51,240","00:40:52,520","A lot just happened."
"767","cue","00:40:52,600","00:40:56,040","He told me when there was Truth or Dare,
he put himself out of that situation"
"768","cue","00:40:56,120","00:40:57,960","when Mitch was the one who told him to go."
"769","cue","00:40:58,040","00:40:59,240","So he was keen for it."
"770","cue","00:40:59,320","00:41:01,960","So he would have been part of
that little Truth or Dare thing"
"771","cue","00:41:02,040","00:41:03,160","if Mitch didn't tell him."
"772","cue","00:41:03,240","00:41:06,920","I really hope he has a good story,"

my mind is going crazy right now."
"774","cue","00:41:11,280","00:41:13,080","[Mitchell] So, wait,
I need to get the story straight."
"775","cue","00:41:13,160","00:41:15,960","Yeah. Claudia's gonna ask, ""Did you
remove yourself from the situation"
"776","cue","00:41:16,040","00:41:17,000","or did he say that?"""
"777","cue","00:41:17,080","00:41:19,160","All I'm going to say is,
this is the truth."
"778","cue","00:41:19,240","00:41:22,040","I told you and you would assume,
""It can't get that bad,"""
"779","cue","00:41:22,120","00:41:23,880","and you've seen how bad it was
and then you left."
"780","cue","00:41:23,960","00:41:28,080","Well, like I said, I said I was trying to
find a way to leave,"
"781","cue","00:41:28,160","00:41:30,680","but I didn't want to be awkward
and ruin it for both of you."
"782","cue","00:41:30,760","00:41:34,960","I am super worried that I'm about to
get in trouble for something"
"783","cue","00:41:35,040","00:41:36,360","that I didn't even do."
"784","cue","00:41:37,160","00:41:39,120","-I wanna go there…
-I think Mitchell said that to Callum."
"785","cue","00:41:39,200","00:41:40,240","…and throw him in the pool."
"786","cue","00:41:40,840","00:41:41,840","Wait, which one?"
"787","cue","00:41:41,920","00:41:44,320","Austen. Because he's trying to play this,
you know…"
"788","cue","00:41:44,400","00:41:45,920","-[Phoebe] Nice.
-""…cute"" little nice boy."
"789","cue","00:41:46,000","00:41:48,040","""No, I ran away.
I'm not getting myself involved."""
"790","cue","00:41:48,120","00:41:49,400","When it was Mitchell
who told him to leave."
"791","cue","00:41:49,480","00:41:50,440","Yeah."
"792","cue","00:41:50,520","00:41:52,000","What the fuck?"
"793","cue","00:41:52,080","00:41:53,640","[Tina] I feel like Austen's a sweetie,"
"794","cue","00:41:53,720","00:41:57,000","and it sounds like with Claudia
he's been nothing but good."
"795","cue","00:41:57,080","00:42:01,360","Claudia was questioning whether he's just
pretending to be this nice, soft guy."
"796","cue","00:42:01,440","00:42:04,120","And I'm like,
""No, I think he's showing you who he is."
"797","cue","00:42:04,200","00:42:05,760","Believe him, Claudia."""
"798","cue","00:42:05,840","00:42:08,080","But you know what,
he might have also been already--"
"799","cue","00:42:08,160","00:42:10,720","That's a statement,
not based on what he actually did."
"800","cue","00:42:10,800","00:42:14,520","Just because one person perceived
that their comment made him go"
"801","cue","00:42:14,600","00:42:16,560","doesn't mean
that's actually why he chose to."
"802","cue","00:42:16,640","00:42:18,840","But then Mitchell said
he definitely would have played."
"803","cue","00:42:18,920","00:42:20,880","Yeah,
but that's what Mitchell's perspective is."
"804","cue","00:42:20,960","00:42:23,200","-[Stella] That's his opinion.
-That's what Mitch thinks about it."
"805","cue","00:42:23,280","00:42:25,480","-Yeah, I'll--
-So who do you trust more?"
"806","cue","00:42:25,560","00:42:28,040","You've got to put Austen's opinion
and Mitchell's opinion."
"807","cue","00:42:28,120","00:42:29,880","Okay, well, Mitch's opinion
and Austen's opinion."
"808","cue","00:42:29,960","00:42:32,280","-That's bad.
-No. Because what the hell?"
"809","cue","00:42:32,360","00:42:34,160","She's not trusting Austen for his word"
"810","cue","00:42:34,240","00:42:37,240","and she's gonna let the comments
from the challenge get in the way."
"811","cue","00:42:37,320","00:42:39,920","But why are you trusting comments
made by other people in the villa?"
"812","cue","00:42:40,000","00:42:43,120","You should be focusing on
the trust that you have with your partner"
"813","cue","00:42:43,200","00:42:44,640","and putting that first."
"814","cue","00:42:44,720","00:42:46,600","That means you don't trust Austen."
"815","cue","00:42:47,720","00:42:50,480","I just want to know why
Mitchell said twice in the quote,"
"816","cue","00:42:50,560","00:42:52,160","he definitely would have stayed."
"817","cue","00:42:52,240","00:42:56,240","He didn't, so he can't have ""definitely
would have"" because he didn't."
"818","cue","00:42:56,320","00:42:59,520","-Exactly. I don't think he did that.
-I would talk to Mitchell about this."
"819","cue","00:43:00,280","00:43:01,400","[Jess] Yeah. Okay."
"820","cue","00:43:01,480","00:43:04,040","I'm trying to figure out
if Claudia is looking for a fight."
"821","cue","00:43:04,120","00:43:08,520","Because why are we still talking about
this Truth or Dare game"
"822","cue","00:43:08,600","00:43:11,440","that Austen didn't even take part in?"
"823","cue","00:43:11,520","00:43:15,520","I feel like there are bigger fish to fry
and that is not one of them."
"824","cue","00:43:15,600","00:43:18,240","It's just hard to trust these boys
when shit's happening like this."
"825","cue","00:43:21,360","00:43:22,680","I want to know the context"
"826","cue","00:43:22,760","00:43:25,480","and I want to know the stories

would be different to Austen's."

Mitchell was the one who said the quote."

what the whole gist was."
"835","cue","00:44:09,120","00:44:11,240","So you two were with Callum,
with Phoebe and Vak."
"836","cue","00:44:11,320","00:44:12,440","Then Austen comes over here--"
"837","cue","00:44:12,520","00:44:14,880","Austen comes over and I was like,
""We're playing Truth or Dare."""
"838","cue","00:44:14,960","00:44:16,600","I said to him,"

he's seen the first dare,"

it was a three-way kiss."

that he wanted to stay here?"
"847","cue","00:44:35,160","00:44:38,160","I don't know why I said that,
because he didn't want to stay."
"848","cue","00:44:38,240","00:44:40,120","-Ah.
-I think when I said that comment,"
"849","cue","00:44:40,200","00:44:42,880","I was just angry
because he was kind of saying,"
"850","cue","00:44:43,400","00:44:45,720","""You guys were up there playing
Truth or Dare and I removed myself."""
"851","cue","00:44:45,800","00:44:48,840","He was trying to say you but then you're
like, ""No, actually, you were there."""
"852","cue","00:44:48,920","00:44:50,160","Yeah, you were there."
"853","cue","00:44:50,240","00:44:53,440","And I think maybe just out of a bit of
anger, I said that he wanted to stay,"
"854","cue","00:44:53,520","00:44:55,240","but he gave no indication
that he wanted to hang around."
"855","cue","00:44:55,320","00:44:57,560","-Okay.
-I'm telling you the whole-hearted truth."
"856","cue","00:44:57,640","00:44:59,240","-Okay, well, that's not that bad.
-Yeah."
"857","cue","00:44:59,320","00:45:00,800","After speaking with Mitch,"
"858","cue","00:45:00,880","00:45:03,400","Austen seems to be in the clear
about the Truth or Dare."
"859","cue","00:45:03,920","00:45:05,560","Obviously he should have told me
more details,"
"860","cue","00:45:05,640","00:45:07,240","but I think they were minute details."
"861","cue","00:45:08,280","00:45:09,720","So, what did he say down there?"
"862","cue","00:45:09,800","00:45:11,680","He said
he thinks he's in the shit with you."
"863","cue","00:45:11,760","00:45:13,200","Oh. Is that all he said?"
"864","cue","00:45:13,280","00:45:15,600","Yeah. Yeah, I think you gotta talk to him."
"865","cue","00:45:15,680","00:45:17,400","I'm not pulling him for a chat."
"866","cue","00:45:17,480","00:45:19,280","We'll just see how long it takes him to--"
"867","cue","00:45:19,360","00:45:21,080","-You all right, though?
-Yeah, I'm fine."
"868","cue","00:45:21,160","00:45:22,480","Okay, sweet."
"869","cue","00:45:22,560","00:45:24,960","[narrator]

"871","cue","00:45:28,040","00:45:29,600","<i>Thanks, Phoebe.</i>"
"872","cue","00:45:30,120","00:45:33,040","-She was kicking off about the…
-Truth or Dare."
"873","cue","00:45:33,120","00:45:35,880","…Truth or Dare. She was like,
""He's just fucking lied."" And we're like--"
"874","cue","00:45:35,960","00:45:37,560","I don't understand how I lied."
"875","cue","00:45:37,640","00:45:41,120","We were like, ""Claudia, at the end of
the day, Austen did not stay."""
"876","cue","00:45:41,200","00:45:45,040","And then she was like, ""Why the fuck would
Mitch say that twice he would leave?"""
"877","cue","00:45:45,120","00:45:48,520","And Tina goes to her, ""Do you trust Mitch
or do you trust Austen?"

"879","cue","00:45:50,040","00:45:54,200","And she goes, ""This is where I trust
Austen, this is where I trust Mitch."""
"880","cue","00:45:54,280","00:45:56,840","-Oh, my God.
-[Phoebe] And then that's when she was--"
"881","cue","00:45:56,920","00:45:59,400","Tina was like, ""There's an obvious issue
in your relationship"
"882","cue","00:45:59,480","00:46:01,440","-because why are you not trusting Austen?""
-[Callum] Yeah."
"883","cue","00:46:02,320","00:46:04,720","Why are you trusting Austen's best friend?
Why aren't you trusting Austen?"
"884","cue","00:46:04,800","00:46:06,040","I want to fucking cry again."
"885","cue","00:46:06,120","00:46:07,560","No, no, no."
"886","cue","00:46:08,080","00:46:09,560","Mitch was the one that stayed
and played the game"
"887","cue","00:46:09,640","00:46:11,280","and apparently
he's more trustworthy than me."
"888","cue","00:46:11,360","00:46:14,280","Wait, I probably shouldn't have
said all that, but anyway."
"889","cue","00:46:14,360","00:46:17,080","-That is shit, though.
-[Austen] That's fucking shit."
"890","cue","00:46:17,160","00:46:19,280","[Callum]
She shouldn't say she trusts Mitch more."
"891","cue","00:46:19,360","00:46:22,160","She trusts Mitch there and Austen there.
Austen's done nothing to break her trust."
"892","cue","00:46:22,240","00:46:23,880","I know, but wait,
you cannot bring that up--"
"893","cue","00:46:23,960","00:46:26,080","No, I am. I don't give a fuck, bro."
"894","cue","00:46:26,160","00:46:28,240","What about me?
I just fucking ran and told you."
"895","cue","00:46:28,320","00:46:30,200","Yeah, but--
Fucking someone's there for me."
"896","cue","00:46:30,280","00:46:32,800","But Phoebe is doing the right thing
by telling you stuff."
"897","cue","00:46:32,880","00:46:34,640","-Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
-[Phoebe] Don't blow it."
"898","cue","00:46:34,720","00:46:36,080","'Cause she'll never tell me anything."
"899","cue","00:46:36,160","00:46:37,680","-[Callum] Yeah.
-I'm helping you."
"900","cue","00:46:37,760","00:46:38,800","[Austen] I'm very tired of this."
"901","cue","00:46:38,880","00:46:41,880","I'm very tired of the arguing
and the drama and, you know…"
"902","cue","00:46:41,960","00:46:44,680","It's like, it's in the villa,
can you imagine the real world?"
"903","cue","00:46:45,520","00:46:46,520","Far out."
"904","cue","00:46:47,040","00:46:49,280","-I don't care.
-She's running rings around you, bro."

"907","cue","00:46:52,520","00:46:55,360","She can't say that shit.
Go and sort it out. Go and pull her."
"908","cue","00:46:55,440","00:46:56,760","It's your missus."
"909","cue","00:46:56,840","00:47:00,480","You're 6'4"",
you're built like a Greek fucking god,"
"910","cue","00:47:00,560","00:47:02,920","and you've got a tan
like an abandoned dirt road."
"911","cue","00:47:03,000","00:47:06,520","Get up there and fucking stamp
your authority on your relationship."
"912","cue","00:47:06,600","00:47:07,920","-[Phoebe] But I don't--
-Say it as it is."
"913","cue","00:47:08,000","00:47:09,000","[Phoebe laughs]"
"914","cue","00:47:09,080","00:47:10,320","-All right.
-[Callum] Goodbye."
"915","cue","00:47:10,840","00:47:11,880","[Austen] See ya."
"916","cue","00:47:12,640","00:47:13,880","What, do you want ice?"
"917","cue","00:47:20,160","00:47:21,600","[Austen] Do you wanna talk or…"
"918","cue","00:47:23,520","00:47:24,520","[Claudia] If you want to."
"919","cue","00:47:26,680","00:47:27,680","Okay, let's go."
"920","cue","00:47:28,200","00:47:30,120","I think it's very important
to hold my ground"
"921","cue","00:47:30,200","00:47:32,440","because I know what I did is not wrong."
"922","cue","00:47:33,880","00:47:35,720","How come you pulled Mitch first
and not me?"
"923","cue","00:47:35,800","00:47:36,640","What?"
"924","cue","00:47:36,720","00:47:39,920","[Austen] I said, how come you pulled Mitch
first and not me? If it was me?"
"925","cue","00:47:40,400","00:47:42,760","[Claudia] 'Cause I just wanted to
confirm what he said."
"926","cue","00:47:42,840","00:47:44,160","Why didn't you pull me first?"
"927","cue","00:47:44,240","00:47:46,880","-Because I wanted to confirm what he said.
-[Austen] What did he say?"
"928","cue","00:47:47,760","00:47:48,800","Okay. So…"
"929","cue","00:47:49,560","00:47:51,640","-I guess my biggest points…
-Mm-hmm."
"930","cue","00:47:53,240","00:47:57,000","The fact that Mitchell said to you
it's gonna get steamy"
"931","cue","00:47:57,080","00:47:58,320","and you were like, ""Okay."""
"932","cue","00:47:58,400","00:48:01,120","Yeah. And from that point onwards,
as soon as he said that,"
"933","cue","00:48:01,200","00:48:03,320","I was like,
""I need to get the fuck out of here."""
"934","cue","00:48:03,400","00:48:05,720","I don't understand what's the big issue,
because I left."
"935","cue","00:48:05,800","00:48:06,960","I could have just stayed."
"936","cue","00:48:07,040","00:48:08,640","So, I don't understand what the issue is."
"937","cue","00:48:08,720","00:48:10,120","Again, there's no trust."
"938","cue","00:48:10,640","00:48:14,040","-Yeah--
-I told you and I expect you to trust me."
"939","cue","00:48:14,560","00:48:17,600","He was angry at me before I was even
angry at him, for some reason."
"940","cue","00:48:17,680","00:48:19,680","I just expect you
not to jump to conclusions."
"941","cue","00:48:19,760","00:48:21,720","That's fine. I do trust you, that's fine,"
"942","cue","00:48:21,800","00:48:23,480","-But I've still got doubts in my head.
-Mm-hmm."
"943","cue","00:48:23,560","00:48:25,400","When I hear that,
that brings them all up again."
"944","cue","00:48:25,480","00:48:29,160","What, do you think I'm gonna be like,
""Nope, Austen told me this. That's it."""
"945","cue","00:48:29,240","00:48:30,240","I wasn't…"
"946","cue","00:48:31,680","00:48:32,680","Yeah."
"947","cue","00:48:33,240","00:48:34,440","Go on, say what you wanna say."
"948","cue","00:48:34,520","00:48:36,000","-No, I'm not allowed to.
-Why not?"
"949","cue","00:48:36,520","00:48:38,760","-I was told not to.
-By who?"
"950","cue","00:48:39,440","00:48:40,680","By people."
"951","cue","00:48:40,760","00:48:43,000","What the fuck does that even mean, Austen?"
"952","cue","00:48:43,080","00:48:44,280","I'm not allowed to say."
"953","cue","00:48:44,360","00:48:46,040","-What does that mean?
-Well, okay."
"954","cue","00:48:46,120","00:48:47,040","All I was told"
"955","cue","00:48:48,280","00:48:50,360","is that down there,
a couple of girls that came up to me"
"956","cue","00:48:50,440","00:48:52,240","and said,
""You have to really talk to Claudia"
"957","cue","00:48:52,320","00:48:57,040","because she did say that my trust is
down here and Mitch's trust is up here."""
"958","cue","00:48:57,120","00:48:58,640","-Mmm.
-Yeah."
"959","cue","00:48:58,720","00:49:01,600","Mitch was up here because he's the one
who said it, and you're down here."
"960","cue","00:49:01,680","00:49:04,560","I'm going to see what Mitchell says
and then I'm gonna talk to you."
"961","cue","00:49:05,360","00:49:07,640","And I'm really sick and fucking tired"
"962","cue","00:49:07,720","00:49:09,680","of Phoebe telling everything
that I've said to you boys."
"963","cue","00:49:09,760","00:49:11,960","-She was doing it to help me.
-I don't care."
"964","cue","00:49:14,440","00:49:16,680","Now I'm confused as to
whose side Phoebe's on"
"965","cue","00:49:16,760","00:49:19,280","because now she's being my friend,
but she was Austen's friend."
"966","cue","00:49:19,360","00:49:21,440","Don't talk to Phoebe. I don't want to
start anything with Phoebe."
"967","cue","00:49:21,520","00:49:23,240","-Phoebe's done nothing.
-Don't talk to Phoebe."
"968","cue","00:49:23,320","00:49:24,880","No. I know she means well by me."
"969","cue","00:49:26,400","00:49:28,000","Yes, she means well by you."
"970","cue","00:49:29,720","00:49:31,080","Okay, I'm done with this conversation."
"971","cue","00:49:33,240","00:49:34,760","I won't talk to Phoebe, it's fine."
"972","cue","00:49:35,400","00:49:37,480","We haven't solved this.
So why are you leaving?"
"973","cue","00:49:37,560","00:49:40,440","[Claudia] Because there's nothing--
What do you want to talk about?"
"974","cue","00:49:40,520","00:49:42,040","Why are you angry now?"
"975","cue","00:49:43,200","00:49:46,400","Maybe we should just not talk
for a little bit and then come back to it."
"976","cue","00:50:04,880","00:50:09,200","[narrator] <i>There's a parallel world</i>
<i>in which, after discovering Mitch lied,</i>"
"977","cue","00:50:09,280","00:50:12,120","<i>Claudia apologized to Austen.</i>"
"978","cue","00:50:12,200","00:50:14,760","<i>Then there's this world,</i>

-[Jess] What happened?"
"984","cue","00:50:27,360","00:50:29,960","You know I said that thing about
Austen being here, Mitchell being here?"
"985","cue","00:50:30,040","00:50:32,120","-[Jess] What-- Oh, yeah.
-The trust thing."
"986","cue","00:50:32,200","00:50:34,600","I'm like, bro, that's completely
taken out of context. You can't--"
"987","cue","00:50:34,680","00:50:36,120","Now he won't let me go up to Phoebe."

"994","cue","00:50:50,200","00:50:52,240","So now he won't let me go talk to Phoebe"
"995","cue","00:50:52,320","00:50:54,880","because Phoebe's got ""his best interests""

and it's just annoying."
"997","cue","00:50:59,800","00:51:01,880","Remember I told you about Phoebe."
"998","cue","00:51:01,960","00:51:03,360","-[Claudia] What did you say?
-I warned you."
"999","cue","00:51:03,440","00:51:04,480","What did you say?"
"1000","cue","00:51:04,560","00:51:06,400","I said she was
one of the biggest gossipers here."
"1001","cue","00:51:06,480","00:51:09,800","But I know she is and I've caught her out
multiple times doing it."
"1002","cue","00:51:09,880","00:51:11,520","-She says she won't do it again.
-It's twisted lies."
"1003","cue","00:51:11,600","00:51:13,160","-[Claudia] And she does it again.
-[Jess] Yeah."
"1004","cue","00:51:13,240","00:51:16,960","Phoebe takes the cake for this one.
She's the naughtiest person in the villa."
"1005","cue","00:51:17,040","00:51:19,720","Probably the biggest gossiper.
Gossip queen number one."

-Why would I be angry at you?"
"1007","cue","00:51:22,800","00:51:25,440","'Cause you think I'm the drama.
You don't want a dramatic girlfriend."

you just say it how it is."
"1009","cue","00:51:28,200","00:51:30,400","If Claudia says something in a chat,"
"1010","cue","00:51:31,000","00:51:35,000","maybe you just need to hear something

"1012","cue","00:51:38,440","00:51:40,280","and so I don't really
think anything of it."
"1013","cue","00:51:40,360","00:51:46,200","I can keep a secret, but it's other
random information I guess I just…"
"1014","cue","00:51:46,280","00:51:47,280","Obviously--"
"1015","cue","00:51:47,840","00:51:51,880","Maybe someone needs to really pinpoint
what is a secret and what is not a secret."
"1016","cue","00:51:53,440","00:51:55,120","Now he's gonna be all upset."
"1017","cue","00:51:55,720","00:51:57,680","[Jess] So, you're gonna
have a second chat with him?"
"1018","cue","00:51:58,200","00:51:59,320","[Claudia] Yeah."
"1019","cue","00:51:59,400","00:52:01,120","-Okay, I need to talk to him.
-[Jess] Okay, go."
"1020","cue","00:52:03,000","00:52:04,000","[Claudia] Can we talk?"
"1021","cue","00:52:04,760","00:52:05,640","[Austen] Mm-hmm."
"1022","cue","00:52:09,200","00:52:12,880","[Claudia] Now I feel like I'm frustrated
with him because of her and--"
"1023","cue","00:52:13,600","00:52:15,680","[sighs] I just--"
"1024","cue","00:52:15,760","00:52:18,600","Phoebe has done my head in.
She's actually done my head in."
"1025","cue","00:52:20,160","00:52:21,920","I'm really confused about you, Austen."
"1026","cue","00:52:28,640","00:52:29,640","I just-- Yeah."
"1027","cue","00:52:30,400","00:52:34,240","I went into that knowing or thinking
that you were gonna be angry at me."
"1028","cue","00:52:36,320","00:52:37,160","But--"
"1029","cue","00:52:37,240","00:52:38,960","And from what Phoebe was telling me
as well--"
"1030","cue","00:52:39,040","00:52:42,720","-I don't care what she was saying--
-But that's how I was going into it."
"1031","cue","00:52:42,800","00:52:46,560","Have your own fucking mind and think about
what you want to think about."
"1032","cue","00:52:46,640","00:52:48,160","Don't be influenced by people."
"1033","cue","00:52:49,320","00:52:52,000","You're the one that's influenced
by other people but I can't--"
"1034","cue","00:52:52,080","00:52:53,760","That's completely different."
"1035","cue","00:52:53,840","00:52:55,520","Phoebe is only coming to me."
"1036","cue","00:52:55,600","00:52:58,840","She's only coming to me
from what she's heard."
"1037","cue","00:52:58,920","00:53:00,680","That's the only reason why she came,
she cares for me."
"1038","cue","00:53:00,760","00:53:06,680","In all these arguments, it's basically
you, Mitchell, Phoebe and Callum"
"1039","cue","00:53:06,760","00:53:08,000","and then Claudia,"
"1040","cue","00:53:08,080","00:53:09,320","when it should be you and I."
"1041","cue","00:53:16,920","00:53:19,560","-Yeah, Phoebe's like--
-[imitates snake hissing] You."
"1042","cue","00:53:22,800","00:53:25,280","{\an8}[Phoebe]"
"1043","cue","00:53:25,360","00:53:27,880","-You're a proper snake, hey?
-[Phoebe] I'm a proper snake."
"1044","cue","00:53:27,960","00:53:29,440","-You're a proper snake.
-You are the worst."
"1045","cue","00:53:29,520","00:53:32,520","-[Phoebe] I'm the worst.
-I'm glad everyone else sees it now."
"1046","cue","00:53:32,600","00:53:34,240","-Guys--
-[laughs]"
"1047","cue","00:53:34,320","00:53:37,200","I didn't even mean to start so much drama."
"1048","cue","00:53:37,280","00:53:40,280","Obviously, I don't do it maliciously
and I'm not trying to start fights--"
"1049","cue","00:53:40,360","00:53:43,880","Unless you see them doing really well and
you want to be the best couple in here,"
"1050","cue","00:53:43,960","00:53:46,840","so you want to bring them down and
sabotage them so you're the best couple."
"1051","cue","00:53:46,920","00:53:48,320","[Mitch]
That's what I would have done to win."
"1052","cue","00:53:48,400","00:53:49,760","So, who started this shit?"
"1053","cue","00:53:50,520","00:53:53,240","-Me.
-Ah, the old head snake."
"1054","cue","00:53:53,920","00:53:55,600","You literally were just blaming me"
"1055","cue","00:53:55,680","00:53:57,520","for something that
I didn't even know what I did."
"1056","cue","00:53:57,600","00:53:58,960","That's why you annoy me."
"1057","cue","00:54:00,280","00:54:02,640","But you didn't even let me
get angry at you before you went off."
"1058","cue","00:54:02,720","00:54:04,320","What do you mean? You were angry at me."
"1059","cue","00:54:04,400","00:54:05,440","We sat down--"
"1060","cue","00:54:05,520","00:54:07,960","No, because in the freaking challenge
you wouldn't let me touch you."
"1061","cue","00:54:08,040","00:54:10,120","You're like, ""Don't touch me.
Don't look at me."" Okay."
"1062","cue","00:54:10,200","00:54:11,760","'Cause I had no explanation."
"1063","cue","00:54:11,840","00:54:14,920","Yeah, well, it's something so minute.
It's a little detail."
"1064","cue","00:54:15,000","00:54:17,000","And if I've told you that I removed myself
from a situation,"
"1065","cue","00:54:17,080","00:54:18,480","no matter what Mitch said,
what anyone said,"
"1066","cue","00:54:18,560","00:54:20,360","you didn't trust what I told you."
"1067","cue","00:54:20,440","00:54:22,240","She hears one quote about me…"
"1068","cue","00:54:23,280","00:54:24,720","Bang, I've done something wrong."
"1069","cue","00:54:24,800","00:54:26,600","""Don't touch me, don't do anything to me,
don't do this."""
"1070","cue","00:54:26,680","00:54:28,440","I'm just like, ""Oh, my God."""
"1071","cue","00:54:29,040","00:54:30,880","How much more have I gotta prove myself?"
"1072","cue","00:54:31,560","00:54:34,400","I did everything right,
but somehow there still was a problem."
"1073","cue","00:54:34,480","00:54:36,400","But I didn't know that
when I was sitting down there."
"1074","cue","00:54:37,360","00:54:38,200","Yep."
"1075","cue","00:54:38,960","00:54:41,360","Do you understand that?
Or you're just saying yes to please me?"
"1076","cue","00:54:41,440","00:54:42,560","No, I understand that."
"1077","cue","00:54:45,040","00:54:48,120","[sighs]
It's like it's just-- What's the point?"
"1078","cue","00:54:48,200","00:54:51,160","I've given her enough reassurance
for her to be able to trust me."
"1079","cue","00:54:51,240","00:54:52,640","So I really don't know."
"1080","cue","00:54:52,720","00:54:53,720","Like…"
"1081","cue","00:54:54,320","00:54:55,160","Yeah."
"1082","cue","00:54:55,800","00:54:57,680","If you're gonna get your back up
at something I've said"
"1083","cue","00:54:57,760","00:54:59,200","to the girls in ""confidence,"""
"1084","cue","00:54:59,280","00:55:01,760","don't get your guard up
before you actually talk to me."
"1085","cue","00:55:02,360","00:55:04,880","Don't say I was getting angry about that
when I didn't even talk to you"
"1086","cue","00:55:04,960","00:55:06,800","'cause you were
doing the exact same thing."
"1087","cue","00:55:06,880","00:55:07,720","Mm-hmm."
"1088","cue","00:55:08,800","00:55:11,280","I need a bit more of an answer
than ""mm-hmm."""
"1089","cue","00:55:19,600","00:55:21,440","-Yep.
-Oh, my God."
"1090","cue","00:55:24,000","00:55:26,080","Do you want to be
having this chat right now?"
"1091","cue","00:55:27,200","00:55:28,560","I want it to be over and done with."
"1092","cue","00:55:28,640","00:55:32,640","I fucking can't stand
arguing with you all the time."
"1093","cue","00:55:34,200","00:55:35,240","Arguing all the time?"
"1094","cue","00:55:35,320","00:55:37,240","I just can't stand arguing in general."
"1095","cue","00:55:41,680","00:55:42,960","[sighs]"
"1096","cue","00:55:43,800","00:55:44,800","Yeah."
"1097","cue","00:55:46,080","00:55:47,080","Yeah. It hurts."
"1098","cue","00:55:56,440","00:55:58,240","How much more can a man take, you know?"
