"175","cue","00:08:48,640","00:08:51,880","about how my head is just
going left, right and center,"
"176","cue","00:08:51,960","00:08:54,320","and I think that's, like, unfair on him,"
"177","cue","00:08:54,400","00:08:56,480","and I just am not vibing it, essentially."
"178","cue","00:08:57,080","00:09:01,680","I don't know. I just feel like
after our couples therapy today, um,"
"179","cue","00:09:01,760","00:09:04,240","I felt like we were
on maybe a different page"
"180","cue","00:09:04,320","00:09:06,800","and I don't wanna be stuffing
you around, basically."
"181","cue","00:09:06,880","00:09:10,200","So that's why I just think
that we should just be friends."
"182","cue","00:09:13,720","00:09:16,040","It's hard to have
that conversation with Tak"
"183","cue","00:09:16,120","00:09:18,400","because I am usually a people pleaser,"
"184","cue","00:09:18,480","00:09:22,760","but this time I had to be more direct
and let him know how I was feeling."
"185","cue","00:09:22,840","00:09:26,720","It's a mature decision,
because, to be honest,"
"186","cue","00:09:26,800","00:09:31,760","I feel like it was always one-sided."
"187","cue","00:09:31,840","00:09:33,560","'Cause you knew how I felt."
"188","cue","00:09:35,640","00:09:37,600","I think I was mugged off a little bit."
"189","cue","00:09:39,880","00:09:41,200","[Stella] Look, I'm sorry"
"190","cue","00:09:41,280","00:09:43,120","-that I've made you feel like that.
-Mmm."
"191","cue","00:09:43,200","00:09:46,640","It makes me feel bad
knowing that I've hurt you like that."
"192","cue","00:09:46,720","00:09:48,880","[Tak] Obviously,
it's a bit of a blow to the guts."
"193","cue","00:09:48,960","00:09:51,960","Where's the person that wants me for me?"
"194","cue","00:09:52,560","00:09:53,760","At the end of the day…"
"195","cue","00:09:55,800","00:09:59,160","it just wasn't meant to be.
And that's okay."

I'm saying that to myself."

how to unpack that information"

if we're both not open to anything,"

"361","cue","00:19:02,680","00:19:06,800","it just solidified
that we can work on the outside."

to have more private times with him"

and they're chatting for fucking ages"

they've been together from before."
"382","cue","00:20:07,240","00:20:10,760","-Have a lot to talk about.
-I can't compete with their times."

and get back with her ex?"
"385","cue","00:20:14,920","00:20:17,560","[Phoebe] So your ex has come in the villa."
"386","cue","00:20:17,640","00:20:20,120","So where do you genuinely
think your head's at?"
"387","cue","00:20:20,200","00:20:23,440","Fuck, I don't know. I don't have
a plan of attack with regards to her."
"388","cue","00:20:23,520","00:20:26,360","-It's kind of like seeing what happens.
-Whatever happens, happens."
"389","cue","00:20:26,440","00:20:28,960","Do you ever think that you guys
would get back together?"
"390","cue","00:20:29,040","00:20:31,880","I never really considered--
I never thought about it, to be fair."
"391","cue","00:20:31,960","00:20:32,960","-Yeah.
-You know?"
"392","cue","00:20:33,040","00:20:36,120","Maybe it is like a case of right person,

I've got my hands full."

"395","cue","00:20:41,240","00:20:44,040","[Callum] He's definitely still
in the picture, which is frustrating,"

she's still semi-attracted to her ex."
"397","cue","00:20:46,640","00:20:49,080","I've got to keep putting
my best foot forward and get into it."

This is it."

and don't fuck it up like I normally do."

"402","cue","00:21:00,320","00:21:02,360","definitely the most important thing
in a relationship."
"403","cue","00:21:02,440","00:21:04,800","The reason why people break up is
because they break trust"
"404","cue","00:21:04,880","00:21:06,960","and try to make it work.
But once you've broken trust…"
"405","cue","00:21:07,040","00:21:09,040","-You know what I relate it to?
-…it's fucked. What?"
"406","cue","00:21:09,120","00:21:10,960","-A piece of paper.

"411","cue","00:21:18,840","00:21:20,600","-Yep. You cheat on them, right?
-Yeah."
"412","cue","00:21:20,680","00:21:22,400","-You scrunch it up.
-Scrunch it up, yeah."
"413","cue","00:21:22,480","00:21:25,080","And then you try to fix it,
and you unscrunch it."
"414","cue","00:21:25,160","00:21:28,320","It's never gonna be the same as it was
'cause that trust is broken."

"416","cue","00:21:29,600","00:21:33,400","but it's never gonna be back to
that perfect bit of A4 paper"
"417","cue","00:21:33,480","00:21:35,160","-that it originally was.
-Mmm."
"418","cue","00:21:36,920","00:21:39,000","-Do you know what's funny, bro?
-What?"

"514","cue","00:26:03,440","00:26:05,720","…would you stop flirting
with all the girls?"
"515","cue","00:26:05,800","00:26:08,400","No, I think I'm just a flirtatious person."
"516","cue","00:26:08,480","00:26:11,840","So if girls want to flirt with me
at the bar, I'll probably--"
"517","cue","00:26:11,920","00:26:13,840","-You'll flirt back?
-No, I'll entertain it,"
"518","cue","00:26:13,920","00:26:17,800","but if it gets too far, when they start
getting touchy-touchy, I'd be like, yeah."
"519","cue","00:26:17,880","00:26:21,960","I have a really bad track record
with walking red flags."
"520","cue","00:26:22,040","00:26:24,680","Actually, I have a track record
of going with men"
"521","cue","00:26:24,760","00:26:27,120","who dub themselves walking red flags."
"522","cue","00:26:27,200","00:26:30,080","[Mitch] Would you consider yourself
a bit of a red flag?"
"523","cue","00:26:30,160","00:26:34,320","[chuckles] Yes, um, 100%.
At least I'm aware of it. So, yeah."
"524","cue","00:26:34,400","00:26:38,320","It was a massive red flag, seeing Callum
up on that bike answering those."
"525","cue","00:26:38,400","00:26:39,360","I was like… [groans]"
"526","cue","00:26:39,440","00:26:41,560","Do you think,
in a relationship circumstance,"
"527","cue","00:26:41,640","00:26:43,800","the grass would still be greener
on the other side?"
"528","cue","00:26:43,880","00:26:46,840","-Depends. Hopefully not. Hopefully--
-Yes or no answer."
"529","cue","00:26:46,920","00:26:48,760","-Fuck. All right.
-[Tak laughs]"
"530","cue","00:26:48,840","00:26:52,720","No, 'cause I want to meet a bird that's
like Astroturf so it's green all the time."
"531","cue","00:26:52,800","00:26:54,480","[all laughing]"
"532","cue","00:26:54,560","00:26:57,360","Once I find my astroturf bird,
it's game over."
"533","cue","00:26:57,440","00:26:59,320","Kids, marriage, job done."
"534","cue","00:27:00,280","00:27:01,160","Jordan."
"535","cue","00:27:01,240","00:27:03,600","Do you still have feelings for bomb Mitch?"
"536","cue","00:27:03,680","00:27:05,080","-[all] Ooh.
-[bell dings]"
"537","cue","00:27:05,160","00:27:08,600","Yes, but I don't know what those are."
"538","cue","00:27:09,080","00:27:11,360","Would you say you're completely
closed off to bomb Mitch?"
"539","cue","00:27:11,440","00:27:13,920","-Good one.
-I'll say no."
"540","cue","00:27:14,000","00:27:17,280","When I first came in, I obviously
was like, ""No, I'm closed off,"""
"541","cue","00:27:17,360","00:27:19,320","but now it's really hard
being in the villa,"
"542","cue","00:27:19,400","00:27:21,840","because I think
you've got to be open to everyone."
"543","cue","00:27:21,920","00:27:24,640","-Mitch.
-Do you trust me?"
"544","cue","00:27:24,720","00:27:26,320","I was gonna ask that."
"545","cue","00:27:26,400","00:27:28,760","-Yes. And I don't know why.
-[bell dings]"
"546","cue","00:27:30,320","00:27:32,440","I just trust him
'cause I'm an idiot, obviously."
"547","cue","00:27:33,800","00:27:36,160","Fire away. [laughs]"
"548","cue","00:27:36,240","00:27:37,240","Big fella."
"549","cue","00:27:37,320","00:27:40,320","Can you see things progressing
more than friendship with Stella?"
"550","cue","00:27:41,480","00:27:45,360","I'm gonna go, yes.
But it's also very early days. Al."
"551","cue","00:27:45,960","00:27:48,800","-Did you sleep with Emily more than once?
-[gasps]"
"552","cue","00:27:48,880","00:27:50,160","-[honks]
-No."
"553","cue","00:27:53,000","00:27:54,400","-[honks]
-No."
"554","cue","00:27:54,480","00:27:56,880","We pretty much didn't speak after it,
to be fair."
"555","cue","00:27:56,960","00:27:58,160","I was like ""Block her."""
"556","cue","00:27:58,240","00:27:59,600","[laughs]"
"557","cue","00:27:59,680","00:28:02,480","-Is Emily hotter than Tina?
-[all] Ooh."
"558","cue","00:28:02,560","00:28:05,000","You did get asked this last time.
I hope it's changed."
"559","cue","00:28:05,080","00:28:07,800","-I'm saying no. I said yes last time.
-[honks]"
"560","cue","00:28:07,880","00:28:11,000","But I think, obviously,
there's a lot more feelings involved."
"561","cue","00:28:11,080","00:28:12,840","Tina is hotter. [laughs]"
"562","cue","00:28:12,920","00:28:15,280","Sorry, Emily. Love you."
"563","cue","00:28:15,360","00:28:18,880","No. Fuck. That just slipped out.
I did not mean that. [laughs]"
"564","cue","00:28:21,200","00:28:22,200","Uh, Mitch bomb."
"565","cue","00:28:22,280","00:28:24,360","If there were
some new bombshells to come in,"
"566","cue","00:28:24,440","00:28:26,960","would you entertain the idea
of getting to know them?"
"567","cue","00:28:27,480","00:28:28,320","[bell dings]"
"568","cue","00:28:28,400","00:28:30,480","I'm gonna be honest.
I would definitely get to know them."
"569","cue","00:28:30,560","00:28:33,360","Any bombshell walks in,
I will get to know, I think."
"570","cue","00:28:33,440","00:28:34,640","I told Jess that as well."
"571","cue","00:28:35,320","00:28:37,240","Oh. Or not? [laughs]"
"572","cue","00:28:37,880","00:28:39,040","[Al] Jess."
"573","cue","00:28:39,120","00:28:42,560","Is there anything that you feel is missing
in our connection?"
"574","cue","00:28:42,640","00:28:43,720","Ooh, that's a good one."
"575","cue","00:28:44,840","00:28:46,160","-Um…
-[bell dings]"
"576","cue","00:28:46,240","00:28:48,560","I feel like there's
still a lot of things to build on."
"577","cue","00:28:48,640","00:28:50,760","I'm not sure I can pinpoint
on what's missing,"
"578","cue","00:28:50,840","00:28:52,480","but I haven't worked that out yet."
"579","cue","00:28:54,000","00:28:57,440","How is there something missing
if I'm the whole goddamn package?"
"580","cue","00:28:57,520","00:29:00,360","-Stella.
-Do you count flirting as cheating?"
"581","cue","00:29:03,160","00:29:04,080","Good answer."
"582","cue","00:29:04,160","00:29:07,000","I do believe a degree of flirting
is all right"
"583","cue","00:29:07,080","00:29:09,240","'cause it's playful
and I'm a confident person"
"584","cue","00:29:09,320","00:29:11,240","and I do like getting attention
here and there."
"585","cue","00:29:11,320","00:29:14,920","But I do believe we will slip up
every once a while."
"586","cue","00:29:15,000","00:29:15,920","It's a red flag."
"587","cue","00:29:16,000","00:29:19,200","Oh, no. Far out. Al, seriously?"
"588","cue","00:29:21,040","00:29:22,760","But I'm just being honest."
"589","cue","00:29:22,840","00:29:25,200","-Red flag.
-Red flag?"
"590","cue","00:29:25,280","00:29:27,480","-All right.
-[Jordan] Trouble in paradise."
"591","cue","00:29:27,560","00:29:28,960","[all laughing]"
"592","cue","00:29:29,040","00:29:32,600","All girls keep asking you, ""I want
you to be honest, to be this, that."""
"593","cue","00:29:32,680","00:29:35,080","I'm being honest.
I'm telling you the truth."
"594","cue","00:29:35,160","00:29:37,920","Then, what, you're not happy?
Maybe I should have lied."
"595","cue","00:29:38,000","00:29:39,560","Get some shit off my chest now."
"596","cue","00:29:41,240","00:29:45,640","Do you think Al's stance on flirting
would be a deal breaker for you?"
"597","cue","00:29:46,240","00:29:47,080","[bell dings]"
"598","cue","00:29:47,160","00:29:50,760","Absolutely.
I believe flirting is cheating."
"599","cue","00:29:50,840","00:29:52,920","I think when you're flirting with someone,"
"600","cue","00:29:53,000","00:29:57,720","you're giving someone else an incorrect
impression that you are available."
"601","cue","00:29:57,800","00:30:01,880","And you could put yourself
in a vulnerable, uncomfortable position."
"602","cue","00:30:01,960","00:30:03,320","Holy…"
"603","cue","00:30:03,400","00:30:06,000","At the end of the day,
flirting is not cheating."
"604","cue","00:30:06,080","00:30:07,640","If you're kissing somebody, it's cheating."
"605","cue","00:30:07,720","00:30:11,120","If you're having any sort of sexual
interaction with somebody, it's cheating."
"606","cue","00:30:11,200","00:30:13,480","Having a flirt at a bar,
that's not cheating."
"607","cue","00:30:13,560","00:30:15,440","That's what you call testing the waters."
"608","cue","00:30:15,520","00:30:19,040","So, obviously you'd be jealous and
won't like me flirting with a bombshell,"
"609","cue","00:30:19,120","00:30:20,840","but it was right to flirt with Jason?"
"610","cue","00:30:20,920","00:30:23,320","-[laughs]
-[all] Ooh."
"611","cue","00:30:25,200","00:30:27,160","-[Tak] Double standards!
-[Jordan] Double standards, yes."
"612","cue","00:30:27,240","00:30:28,400","-Classic girls.
-Tit for tat."
"613","cue","00:30:29,840","00:30:34,080","Yes, I guess
when I had my date with Jason,"
"614","cue","00:30:34,160","00:30:38,040","I think our connection was
on a lower level than what it is now…"
"615","cue","00:30:38,120","00:30:40,000","-Flirting is cheating.
-…for me anyway. [laughs]"
"616","cue","00:30:40,080","00:30:42,120","-Yeah.
-She admitted that she did it."
"617","cue","00:30:42,200","00:30:47,080","So, I feel like she's really got to
practice what she preaches here."
"618","cue","00:30:49,800","00:30:50,760","Hit me."
"619","cue","00:30:50,840","00:30:55,200","Do you feel like anything is missing
in your connection with Phoebe H?"
"620","cue","00:30:55,280","00:30:56,160","[bell dings]"
"621","cue","00:30:56,240","00:31:01,120","Yes, I know Phoebe H is only 21
and she's got a lot of growth to do."
"622","cue","00:31:02,240","00:31:03,240","Stella."
"623","cue","00:31:03,320","00:31:06,080","Could you see a relationship
with Phoebe H on the outside?"
"624","cue","00:31:06,160","00:31:08,000","-[honks]
-No, not at this point in time."
"625","cue","00:31:08,080","00:31:12,480","Um, I think with my age and maturity
compared to Phoebe H's,"
"626","cue","00:31:12,560","00:31:14,400","I think we are definitely
on a different level."
"627","cue","00:31:15,400","00:31:20,040","I felt a bit hurt, honestly,
at Jordan's answers."
"628","cue","00:31:20,120","00:31:21,080","Jess."
"629","cue","00:31:21,160","00:31:25,760","If Phoebe H was with us on day one,
would you still have chosen Claudia?"
"630","cue","00:31:25,840","00:31:28,040","-[bell dings]
-Yes. Initial attraction."
"631","cue","00:31:28,120","00:31:30,240","Um, Claudia's a beautiful girl."
"632","cue","00:31:30,320","00:31:32,560","His answers were very blunt and quick."
"633","cue","00:31:32,640","00:31:33,600","Jess."
"634","cue","00:31:33,680","00:31:36,360","Do you see life with Jordan
on the outside?"
"635","cue","00:31:36,440","00:31:37,480","[bell dings]"
"636","cue","00:31:37,560","00:31:40,400","I do. But, yeah, it's early days."
"637","cue","00:31:40,480","00:31:41,480","I'd hope so."
"638","cue","00:31:41,560","00:31:44,960","I think I just like the guy
more than he likes me."
"639","cue","00:31:45,040","00:31:50,560","Did some of the responses that Jordan said
on the Truth Bike raise alarm bells?"
"640","cue","00:31:50,640","00:31:52,760","-[bell dinging]

but I respect, you know, him being honest."

"652","cue","00:32:38,960","00:32:41,000","And you also said you'd flirt with her."

I wanna get to know you."" X, Y, Z."
"659","cue","00:32:58,760","00:33:02,240","Flirting I think it's a big definition.
It can mean a lot of different things."

""Hey, I love your teeth"" or something."

That's flirting."

if a bombshell were to walk in?"

the ""flirting is just instantly cheating."""

"682","cue","00:34:07,440","00:34:09,199","Being 21, it doesn't fucking matter."
"683","cue","00:34:09,280","00:34:11,719","I don't see myself as immature."
"684","cue","00:34:11,800","00:34:15,239","I felt like I was getting blasted up there
and I just could not hold the tears in."
"685","cue","00:34:15,320","00:34:17,400","I just feel like… [sniffs]"
"686","cue","00:34:17,480","00:34:22,120","…I just got the answers
that I didn't really wanna hear."
"687","cue","00:34:22,199","00:34:24,920","-It just came out of nowhere.
-Yeah."
"688","cue","00:34:25,000","00:34:27,880","-[Phoebe H] I didn't realize that--
-[Stella] That he was feeling like that."
"689","cue","00:34:27,960","00:34:33,560","He said no, he can't see himself
in a relationship with me on the outside."
"690","cue","00:34:33,639","00:34:37,280","Literally, I'm here for a relationship
and I'm here for something special."
"691","cue","00:34:37,360","00:34:39,520","-It's just embarrassing and I felt like…
-Yeah."
"692","cue","00:34:39,600","00:34:42,360","…he could have just
said something a lot nicer."
"693","cue","00:34:43,520","00:34:44,800","[sniffs]"
"694","cue","00:34:44,880","00:34:46,719","It's just not nice to hear."
"695","cue","00:34:46,800","00:34:47,800","[sniffs]"
"696","cue","00:34:51,480","00:34:55,159","-I just feel quite hurt.
-Mm-hmm."
"697","cue","00:34:56,080","00:34:59,320","-And just a bit embarrassed.
-Embarrassed, yep."
"698","cue","00:34:59,840","00:35:00,920","'Cause… [sighs]"
"699","cue","00:35:01,000","00:35:05,960","…I just feel like you could have
given a bit more to your answer"
"700","cue","00:35:06,040","00:35:09,720","or maybe have not worded it
the way that you did."
"701","cue","00:35:09,800","00:35:12,920","Up there, it's hard,
because you get asked a question"
"702","cue","00:35:13,000","00:35:16,440","and you've got to answer it very surely,
but there's so many variables in it."
"703","cue","00:35:16,520","00:35:21,880","I spoke the truth.
So, yeah, I don't regret anything I said."
"704","cue","00:35:22,480","00:35:25,720","-Being called 21 or immature…
-Yeah."
"705","cue","00:35:25,800","00:35:27,720","-…hasn't really sat well with me.
-Yeah."
"706","cue","00:35:28,320","00:35:30,680","So, in that, I said age doesn't matter."
"707","cue","00:35:30,760","00:35:35,640","It just came across
like your maturity level is up here"
"708","cue","00:35:35,720","00:35:38,600","and mine is just down here
because of my age."
"709","cue","00:35:38,680","00:35:40,800","You don't believe
our maturity levels are different?"
"710","cue","00:35:40,880","00:35:42,080","[sighs]"
"711","cue","00:35:42,160","00:35:43,880","I don't know how to explain it, like--"
"712","cue","00:35:45,120","00:35:47,280","Jordan always has an answer,"
"713","cue","00:35:47,360","00:35:51,680","but I feel like I was trying to just
more emphasize on the fact"
"714","cue","00:35:51,760","00:35:55,120","that I was really embarrassed
and hurt in the moment."
"715","cue","00:35:55,200","00:35:56,320","It's early days"
"716","cue","00:35:56,400","00:36:00,680","and you don't have to say that
you see a relationship outside of this."
"717","cue","00:36:00,760","00:36:03,400","But to me, when you straightaway said no,"
"718","cue","00:36:03,480","00:36:08,840","I was hopeful that maybe after this
there could be something more to it."
"719","cue","00:36:08,920","00:36:12,240","I look at it from a massive perspective."
"720","cue","00:36:12,320","00:36:14,960","I don't know
how you get along with my friends."
"721","cue","00:36:15,040","00:36:17,160","I don't know how you live yet,
with someone,"
"722","cue","00:36:17,240","00:36:18,600","you've never moved out of home."
"723","cue","00:36:18,680","00:36:19,920","There's so many variables."
"724","cue","00:36:20,000","00:36:22,480","So, for me,
in that situation then and there,"
"725","cue","00:36:22,560","00:36:23,560","-when someone says…
-[sniffs]"
"726","cue","00:36:23,640","00:36:26,480","""…Do you see something moving out there?""
Right here and now? No."
"727","cue","00:36:26,560","00:36:27,960","I'm not gonna just tell you
what you wanna hear,"
"728","cue","00:36:28,040","00:36:31,080","and say, ""Do you wanna say something?""
and be like ""Yeah, I do,"" because I don't."
"729","cue","00:36:31,160","00:36:34,360","I don't think all my answers
were embarrassing and hurtful, no."
"730","cue","00:36:34,440","00:36:38,000","I guess I just went a bit too short
on answers with them."
"731","cue","00:36:43,040","00:36:45,360","You didn't say anything nice about me."
"732","cue","00:36:46,680","00:36:47,680","At all."
"733","cue","00:36:50,120","00:36:52,200","And then yet
you've been intimate with me in bed"
"734","cue","00:36:52,280","00:36:55,720","and it's just like-- I feel like
what the fuck am I doing here then?"
"735","cue","00:36:56,680","00:37:00,160","And I'm sorry about that,
but I guess I got lost in the moment"
"736","cue","00:37:00,240","00:37:02,720","that the questions they asked me,
I had to answer them."
"737","cue","00:37:03,320","00:37:05,120","Most of it was just a bit brutal."
"738","cue","00:37:05,760","00:37:08,280","Yeah, it was brutal.
But that was the game."
"739","cue","00:37:08,360","00:37:09,600","It's meant to be brutal."
"740","cue","00:37:17,800","00:37:22,040","Like, I just want to pretend
it didn't happen."
"741","cue","00:37:23,840","00:37:25,160","[laughs]"
"742","cue","00:37:26,400","00:37:29,680","Come here, my little lion."
"743","cue","00:37:30,360","00:37:31,800","Little? Big lion."
"744","cue","00:37:31,880","00:37:33,720","[Phoebe H]

"745","cue","00:37:33,800","00:37:38,040","and I'm just gonna think positive

"746","cue","00:37:38,120","00:37:40,600","that we come out of this a bit stronger."

"765","cue","00:38:46,600","00:38:47,520","Fuck me."
"766","cue","00:38:51,000","00:38:53,280","[sighs] It is such a tough decision."
"767","cue","00:38:53,360","00:38:57,440","Like, someone's life in the villa
is at my hands."
"768","cue","00:38:57,520","00:39:00,080","Yeah, I don't know. I'm nervous."
"769","cue","00:39:00,800","00:39:02,720","So, if we had coupled up
at the last recoupling,"
"770","cue","00:39:02,800","00:39:05,320","everything would have been so different
to where it is right now."
"771","cue","00:39:05,400","00:39:07,560","I think when you couple up with someone,"
"772","cue","00:39:07,640","00:39:10,640","-it just opens the doors for like--
-100%. You never know what happens."
"773","cue","00:39:10,720","00:39:15,440","Callum is really nice
and he's always been my friend."

"775","cue","00:39:18,720","00:39:23,440","but I'm worried that he is
still really invested in Tina."
"776","cue","00:39:23,960","00:39:26,440","With her, we're just try and taking
all the history and shit"
"777","cue","00:39:26,520","00:39:27,400","out of the equation."

you're a really nice guy."

-You're in a really tough situation here."
"780","cue","00:39:34,320","00:39:36,760","I'm not gonna lie.
It's gonna be a very hard night, I think."
"781","cue","00:39:38,360","00:39:40,960","-How you feeling?
-[Tina] Shit."
"782","cue","00:39:41,040","00:39:45,000","Everything was going good with Callum,
but I'm not stupid."
"783","cue","00:39:45,080","00:39:47,400","I've kind of picked up
what he's putting down."
"784","cue","00:39:47,480","00:39:49,600","I don't know if he really meets my level."
"785","cue","00:39:50,320","00:39:52,280","I feel like you're such a flight risk"
"786","cue","00:39:52,360","00:39:55,040","'cause you are such a lad,
and you know it."
"787","cue","00:39:55,120","00:39:57,720","I haven't proved--
I haven't given you reason to think--"

"789","cue","00:39:59,200","00:40:03,440","But I feel like I am quite mature
and-- in what I'm looking for and stuff."
"790","cue","00:40:03,520","00:40:06,200","I don't trust that he wouldn't be
looking at the bomb"
"791","cue","00:40:06,280","00:40:08,640","and running to the next one
that's coming in."
"792","cue","00:40:08,720","00:40:10,720","I think Callum even said
today in the challenge,"
"793","cue","00:40:10,800","00:40:13,680","""The grass is greener,"" or some shit.
I don't even know."

and I'm feeling so confused."

"797","cue","00:40:21,160","00:40:24,920","'cause I don't know
how much I see it realistically going"
"798","cue","00:40:25,000","00:40:27,160","on the outside with Callum."
"799","cue","00:40:27,240","00:40:29,800","I feel like there were
just some things today on the bike."
"800","cue","00:40:29,880","00:40:31,320","The way he answered questions,"
"801","cue","00:40:31,400","00:40:33,800","some of those answers
didn't really mesh with me."
"802","cue","00:40:35,280","00:40:37,000","I'd love to have more time with Tak."
"803","cue","00:40:37,080","00:40:39,560","I think there might be something
there with him."
"804","cue","00:40:40,240","00:40:43,320","I obviously have only just started
getting to know you."
"805","cue","00:40:43,400","00:40:45,880","So, it's like,
I don't want to see you go either."
"806","cue","00:40:45,960","00:40:48,600","At the end of the day,
I would like to get to know you better."

I'm gonna understand."
"808","cue","00:40:52,120","00:40:53,320","Oh, my God."
"809","cue","00:40:53,400","00:40:56,640","I'm crying, but just 'cause
I'm really frustrated and confused"
"810","cue","00:40:56,720","00:40:58,240","that this is all happening at once."
"811","cue","00:40:58,320","00:41:01,560","I just don't know,
and I just don't like that text."
"812","cue","00:41:02,840","00:41:06,240","If I'm honest, I was gonna pull you today,
which I've been avoiding all day."
"813","cue","00:41:06,320","00:41:07,520","-But I did think this--
-Why?"
"814","cue","00:41:07,600","00:41:09,600","And I was almost gonna say, like…"
"815","cue","00:41:09,680","00:41:13,160","I don't even know if it's best
if you do pick me."
"816","cue","00:41:15,800","00:41:17,200","Very confused right now, you know."
"817","cue","00:41:17,280","00:41:18,920","I didn't come here to get back with Tina"
"818","cue","00:41:19,000","00:41:20,920","and she didn't come here
to get back with me."
"819","cue","00:41:21,000","00:41:23,320","But as much as we both
want to be here for ourselves"
"820","cue","00:41:23,400","00:41:27,000","to explore other connections,
we are just getting drawn to each other."

"850","cue","00:43:14,600","00:43:15,600","[Sophie] Oh, okay."
"851","cue","00:43:15,680","00:43:18,120","It does that, that bike.
They need that in the court system."
"852","cue","00:43:18,200","00:43:20,080","-Yeah.
-[Sophie] For serial killers."
"853","cue","00:43:20,640","00:43:23,760","Now, Islanders, it's time to get serious."
"854","cue","00:43:27,760","00:43:30,440","There are currently five couples
in the villa."
"855","cue","00:43:32,160","00:43:33,240","Stella and Tak."
"856","cue","00:43:35,720","00:43:37,120","Claudia and Austen."
"857","cue","00:43:40,000","00:43:41,520","Phoebe S and Mitchell."

"859","cue","00:43:48,080","00:43:49,200","Phoebe H and Jordan."
"860","cue","00:43:51,680","00:43:53,280","And there are three singles."
"861","cue","00:43:54,920","00:43:55,920","Mitch."
"862","cue","00:43:56,960","00:43:57,960","Tina."
"863","cue","00:43:58,840","00:43:59,840","And Callum."
"864","cue","00:44:02,920","00:44:04,640","Thirteen beautiful Islanders."
"865","cue","00:44:05,440","00:44:08,120","But shortly, there will be 12."
"866","cue","00:44:10,400","00:44:14,800","One of you has already
spent their final night in the villa."
"867","cue","00:44:22,000","00:44:24,080","Tonight is Ladies' Night."
"868","cue","00:44:24,880","00:44:26,480","Girls will pick boys,"
"869","cue","00:44:26,560","00:44:30,960","and the boy who is left single
will be dumped from the villa tonight."
"870","cue","00:44:31,520","00:44:33,960","[suspenseful music playing]"
"871","cue","00:44:39,280","00:44:43,200","Boys, please come and stand on the stairs
and face the girls."
"872","cue","00:45:08,280","00:45:10,080","Girls, it's time to couple up."
"873","cue","00:45:12,480","00:45:14,880","Phoebe S, you're up first."
"874","cue","00:45:22,160","00:45:27,560","I would like to couple up with this boy
because I feel like every day I'm in here,"
"875","cue","00:45:27,640","00:45:31,480","I'm counting my lucky stars
that he came into my life."
"876","cue","00:45:31,560","00:45:34,840","I feel really grateful
that I'm on this journey with him."
"877","cue","00:45:35,440","00:45:39,600","I genuinely have never been this happy
before with any other guy in my life."
"878","cue","00:45:39,680","00:45:40,720","Wow."
"879","cue","00:45:40,800","00:45:43,880","So, the boy I'd like to couple up with is…"
"880","cue","00:45:46,080","00:45:47,080","Mitchell."
"881","cue","00:45:58,320","00:45:59,880","-Great speech.
-[laughs]"
"882","cue","00:45:59,960","00:46:01,960","Mitchell E,
she's thanking her lucky stars."
"883","cue","00:46:02,040","00:46:03,800","-[Mitchell] I know.
-Have you had a girl do that before?"
"884","cue","00:46:03,880","00:46:06,280","-No, not thanking her lucky stars.
-[laughing]"
"885","cue","00:46:06,360","00:46:07,640","-[Sophie] No?
-Not that, nah."
"886","cue","00:46:07,720","00:46:09,040","-[chuckles]
-[Sophie] No."
"887","cue","00:46:09,120","00:46:11,480","And Phoebe, you had a little twinkle
in your eye there."
"888","cue","00:46:11,560","00:46:13,120","-It's making me smile.
-[laughs]"
"889","cue","00:46:13,200","00:46:15,080","I'm so giddy. [laughs]"
"890","cue","00:46:17,560","00:46:19,640","Jessica, please stand up."
"891","cue","00:46:23,280","00:46:26,120","Which boy would you like to couple up with
and why?"
"892","cue","00:46:27,080","00:46:28,680","I would like to couple up with this boy"
"893","cue","00:46:28,760","00:46:34,120","because every day our connection
is getting stronger and stronger."
"894","cue","00:46:34,200","00:46:37,640","He's hot, he's funny
and he makes me laugh."
"895","cue","00:46:37,720","00:46:42,440","And I'm starting to envision a life
with him outside the villa."
"896","cue","00:46:43,760","00:46:46,800","So, the boy I'd like to couple up with is…"
"897","cue","00:46:49,800","00:46:50,800","Al."
"898","cue","00:47:01,520","00:47:02,560","[Al speaks indistinctly]"

"901","cue","00:47:13,960","00:47:15,960","I would like to couple up with this boy"
"902","cue","00:47:16,040","00:47:21,320","because he makes me very happy
every single day."
"903","cue","00:47:21,400","00:47:25,400","He is constantly teaching me
and constantly dealing with my crap"
"904","cue","00:47:26,040","00:47:28,480","and still is around somehow."
"905","cue","00:47:28,560","00:47:30,800","[laughs]
He showed me what I've been missing"
"906","cue","00:47:30,880","00:47:34,000","and what I never thought
I would find in a guy."
"907","cue","00:47:35,280","00:47:39,760","So, for that reason,
the boy I would like to couple up with is…"
"908","cue","00:47:42,520","00:47:44,960","Austen. [chuckles]"
"909","cue","00:47:55,880","00:47:56,880","[Sophie] So sweet."
"910","cue","00:47:57,400","00:48:00,280","Claudia, when you say he puts up
with your crap, are you hard work?"
"911","cue","00:48:00,360","00:48:01,840","-Yeah.
-Oh. [Sophie laughs]"
"912","cue","00:48:01,920","00:48:03,560","No beating around the bush. Yeah."
"913","cue","00:48:05,480","00:48:06,840","Is she hard work, Austen?"
"914","cue","00:48:07,640","00:48:09,840","-No.
-[all laughing]"
"915","cue","00:48:12,640","00:48:14,640","-That was good. [laughs]
-Thanks. [laughs]"
"916","cue","00:48:16,080","00:48:18,000","Phoebe H, please stand up."
"917","cue","00:48:22,080","00:48:24,960","Which boy would you like
to couple up with and why?"
"918","cue","00:48:26,080","00:48:31,160","I would like to couple up with this boy
because he genuinely makes me so happy."
"919","cue","00:48:31,240","00:48:35,920","There are a lot of qualities in him
that I do love"
"920","cue","00:48:36,000","00:48:38,840","and look for in a potential partner."
"921","cue","00:48:39,520","00:48:42,440","We did have a bit of a speed bump today."
"922","cue","00:48:42,520","00:48:45,320","But… [laughs] …yeah, we communicated"
"923","cue","00:48:45,400","00:48:50,640","and yeah, he's very good with
reassuring me and putting my mind at ease."
"924","cue","00:48:50,720","00:48:54,480","So, the boy that I'd like to
couple up with is…"
"925","cue","00:48:58,080","00:48:59,200","Jordan."
"926","cue","00:49:07,000","00:49:08,600","-Hey.
-[both laughing]"
"927","cue","00:49:09,800","00:49:12,400","Jordan, you survived the Truth Bike,
by the looks of things."
"928","cue","00:49:12,480","00:49:15,440","-Yeah, by the skin of me teeth I think.
-Yeah. [Sophie laughs]"
"929","cue","00:49:33,160","00:49:34,720","Stella, please stand up."
"930","cue","00:49:40,560","00:49:44,080","Stella, which boy would you like to
couple up with and why?"
"931","cue","00:49:47,480","00:49:48,920","I would like to couple up with this boy"
"932","cue","00:49:49,000","00:49:51,680","because I do believe
he is a really genuine guy."
"933","cue","00:49:53,680","00:49:56,960","He's always been so nice to me and
making the effort to pull me for chats."
"934","cue","00:50:01,520","00:50:04,000","And I would like to explore
this connection further."
"935","cue","00:50:07,760","00:50:10,320","So, the boy I would like to
couple up with is…"
"936","cue","00:50:16,600","00:50:17,600","Mitch."
"937","cue","00:50:30,280","00:50:33,960","Mitch, first time you've
been coupled up in about a year."
"938","cue","00:50:34,040","00:50:35,240","[all laughing]"
"939","cue","00:50:35,880","00:50:38,560","Yeah, it feels weird.
Brings back a lot of memories."
"940","cue","00:50:38,640","00:50:40,480","-All good and bad, so…
-[Sophie] Yeah."
"941","cue","00:50:40,560","00:50:42,880","And Stella,
you've been in here for a little while."
"942","cue","00:50:42,960","00:50:44,320","-Was it a hard decision?
-[Stella] Mm-hmm."
"943","cue","00:50:44,400","00:50:46,360","Yeah, I just kind of came down to"
"944","cue","00:50:46,440","00:50:48,560","that I haven't actually
known Mitch for too long."
"945","cue","00:50:48,640","00:50:51,880","So, it would be good to
get the chance to get to know him more"
"946","cue","00:50:51,960","00:50:54,520","and we both seem to be
on the same page, so…"
"947","cue","00:51:06,840","00:51:10,680","[sighs]
Callum and Tak, you know what this means?"
"948","cue","00:51:16,800","00:51:19,240","One of you is about to be dumped
from the island."
"949","cue","00:51:24,760","00:51:26,680","Tina, please stand up."
"950","cue","00:51:33,680","00:51:36,360","Which boy would you like to couple up with
and why?"
"951","cue","00:51:39,160","00:51:42,080","I'd like to couple up with this boy
because…"
"952","cue","00:51:43,480","00:51:45,880","from my short time in the villa,"
"953","cue","00:51:45,960","00:51:48,240","I feel like
we're already in the right direction"
"954","cue","00:51:48,320","00:51:50,600","and I'm really enjoying
getting to know him."
"955","cue","00:51:57,320","00:52:01,440","I'm just keen to be in a couple and
further explore the connection with him."
"956","cue","00:52:15,200","00:52:17,880","So, the boy I would like to
couple up with is…"
"957","cue","00:52:34,200","00:52:37,800","[narrator] <i>Tina is the last girl standing</i>
<i>in tonight's recoupling</i>"
"958","cue","00:52:37,880","00:52:40,360","<i>and must now choose</i>

"962","cue","00:53:06,520","00:53:07,480","[kisses]"
"963","cue","00:53:10,320","00:53:12,240","[Sophie] Callum, massive sigh of relief."
"964","cue","00:53:12,320","00:53:14,080","-Definitely nice feeling.
-[Sophie] Yeah."
"965","cue","00:53:14,160","00:53:15,160","[Callum] Very happy."
"966","cue","00:53:15,680","00:53:17,520","Tina, was that a tough one for you?"
"967","cue","00:53:18,360","00:53:20,520","I think it's always a tough one
when you're up here"
"968","cue","00:53:20,600","00:53:22,600","and, like, seeing someone go home"
"969","cue","00:53:22,680","00:53:25,960","who I've barely gotten the chance
to really know in these couple of days"
"970","cue","00:53:26,040","00:53:27,880","is making it a lot harder."
"971","cue","00:53:28,440","00:53:29,760","Tak, come on down."
"972","cue","00:53:32,280","00:53:33,640","How are you feeling?"
"973","cue","00:53:33,720","00:53:36,320","-I'm good.
-Yes? You've done so well."
"974","cue","00:53:36,400","00:53:38,360","-Nah, it's been a pleasure.
-Yeah."
"975","cue","00:53:38,440","00:53:41,080","Have you learned a lot
through this experience?"
"976","cue","00:53:41,160","00:53:43,760","Yeah, for sure.
I think I've learned a lot about myself"
"977","cue","00:53:43,840","00:53:47,400","and, um, what I look for
and, you know, what I deserve,"
"978","cue","00:53:47,480","00:53:49,280","and it's been absolutely amazing"
"979","cue","00:53:49,360","00:53:52,680","and I hope all the best for you guys.
Truly, I do."
"980","cue","00:53:52,760","00:53:55,440","Tak,
unfortunately you have been left single,"
"981","cue","00:53:55,520","00:53:57,440","which means
you are dumped from the island."
"982","cue","00:53:59,440","00:54:02,000","The rest of you,
good luck and I'll see you soon."
"983","cue","00:54:02,080","00:54:03,160","-Okay, see you.
-See ya."
"984","cue","00:54:03,240","00:54:04,720","-See you, guys.
-Bye, Sophie."

"986","cue","00:54:17,400","00:54:20,200","-[groans] I'll chat to you later.
-Yeah, of course."
"987","cue","00:54:21,200","00:54:22,680","[laughs]"
"988","cue","00:54:26,000","00:54:27,640","-Love you. [laughs]
-[Tak] I love you too."

-I'll miss you too."
"991","cue","00:54:34,960","00:54:38,120","[Stella]
Tak and I went through so much together."
"992","cue","00:54:38,200","00:54:41,120","It's really sad to see Tak go."
"993","cue","00:54:41,200","00:54:43,480","He has been such a good friend of mine"
"994","cue","00:54:43,560","00:54:46,440","throughout
this entire <i>Love Island</i> experience,"
"995","cue","00:54:46,520","00:54:48,440","and it's gonna be weird without him here."
"996","cue","00:54:48,520","00:54:53,160","I had fun in Spain, in this place.
Kissing girls and shit."
"997","cue","00:54:53,240","00:54:56,440","The one thing I'm taking out of it
is just be yourself."
"998","cue","00:54:56,520","00:55:01,200","I still believe that
I gave more than enough of myself"
"999","cue","00:55:01,280","00:55:04,040","and never really got that back."
"1000","cue","00:55:04,120","00:55:08,560","I don't feel like I really had anyone here
that was for me."
"1001","cue","00:55:08,640","00:55:10,920","And that's okay, you know."
"1002","cue","00:55:11,000","00:55:13,480","You'll be all right,
even if you don't make it to the end."
"1003","cue","00:55:13,560","00:55:18,560","It really is a luck thing, and I was
just as lucky as a three-leaf clover."
"1004","cue","00:55:18,640","00:55:20,000","I was just missing a leaf."
"1005","cue","00:55:20,720","00:55:21,960","-Tak.
-[all] Aw."
"1006","cue","00:55:22,040","00:55:25,040","-What is this?
-We need our last tea time with Tak."
"1007","cue","00:55:25,120","00:55:26,800","[all] Aw."
"1008","cue","00:55:27,720","00:55:29,360","It sucks that Tak's going home."
"1009","cue","00:55:29,440","00:55:32,240","Tak's literally my best guy mate in here."
"1010","cue","00:55:32,320","00:55:35,360","He was the one that I go to for advice,"
"1011","cue","00:55:35,440","00:55:39,720","bit of gossip
and just to have a laugh with."
"1012","cue","00:55:39,800","00:55:43,440","And I talk a lot of anime with Tak,
so it's just gonna suck to not have that."
"1013","cue","00:55:44,160","00:55:48,680","We obviously just want to say
you are our go-to guy."
"1014","cue","00:55:48,760","00:55:51,040","-You're our knight in shining armor.
-No."
"1015","cue","00:55:51,120","00:55:54,160","-And you are our best friend.
-Our best friend."
"1016","cue","00:55:54,240","00:55:55,520","Stop it. You're gonna make me cry."
"1017","cue","00:55:55,600","00:55:58,880","No, but who are we gonna D and M with?
You're our go-to D and M."
"1018","cue","00:55:58,960","00:56:00,320","Well, you guys have your partners now."
"1019","cue","00:56:00,400","00:56:02,480","-Cry-on-your-shoulder guy.
-But it's not the same."
"1020","cue","00:56:02,560","00:56:04,120","-I know.
-It's not the same."
"1021","cue","00:56:04,200","00:56:07,080","Now you've lost your best friend here."
"1022","cue","00:56:07,160","00:56:09,840","You need to start looking for
your best friend in your partner as well."
"1023","cue","00:56:10,480","00:56:12,680","-I don't want to.
-Me too."
"1024","cue","00:56:12,760","00:56:14,920","[both laughing, sniffling]"
"1025","cue","00:56:15,920","00:56:16,920","Love you, Tak."
"1026","cue","00:56:17,000","00:56:18,640","-I love you guys.
-Love you too."
"1027","cue","00:56:18,720","00:56:23,720","Tak was honestly like this, you know,
shining diamond that no one noticed."
"1028","cue","00:56:23,800","00:56:27,720","Like, everyone just kept missing it
and it was just so frustrating,"
"1029","cue","00:56:27,800","00:56:29,840","but someone will see it… [laughs]"
"1030","cue","00:56:29,920","00:56:32,440","…eventually, and I can't wait
for that moment."
"1031","cue","00:56:32,520","00:56:36,360","I really appreciate the friendship,
you know, we've built in here."
"1032","cue","00:56:36,440","00:56:38,720","Been through some shit.
Been through lots of good stuff."
"1033","cue","00:56:38,800","00:56:39,680","Fuck yeah, bro."
"1034","cue","00:56:39,760","00:56:41,920","-I'm gonna miss you like crazy.
-Yeah, bro."
"1035","cue","00:56:42,000","00:56:44,800","Don't make me tear up. I said
I wasn't gonna tear up for the girls."
"1036","cue","00:56:44,880","00:56:46,680","-Now you're gonna make me. That's fucked.
-[laughs]"
"1037","cue","00:56:46,760","00:56:49,160","-Don't, 'cause I don't want to either.
-Yeah, none of that."
"1038","cue","00:56:49,240","00:56:50,760","-No. None of that.
-[laughs]"
"1039","cue","00:56:50,840","00:56:52,960","[Jordan]
Tak was very important to me in the villa."
"1040","cue","00:56:53,040","00:56:55,280","He was sort of the brains
that I didn't have."
"1041","cue","00:56:55,360","00:56:57,400","[Jordan]
We really just bounced off each other."
"1042","cue","00:56:57,480","00:57:00,240","So, yeah, I'm gonna really miss that
about him for sure."
"1043","cue","00:57:00,320","00:57:01,960","-Hug, brother.
-Hug it out."
"1044","cue","00:57:02,840","00:57:04,720","Honestly, I thank you for everything."
"1045","cue","00:57:05,400","00:57:09,360","You're a real genuine bloke and I think
we'll be good mates on the outside."
"1046","cue","00:57:12,280","00:57:14,400","Ah. Fucking hell. [laughs]"
"1047","cue","00:57:14,480","00:57:17,600","-Big group hug. Come on. Get in.
-Big group hug."
"1048","cue","00:57:17,680","00:57:19,200","[all cheering, chattering]"
"1049","cue","00:57:21,240","00:57:22,360","[Jess] Love you, Tak."
"1050","cue","00:57:23,360","00:57:26,680","I want the best for all of you guys,
so just attack it, you know?"
"1051","cue","00:57:26,760","00:57:28,240","-Attack it.
-Attack it."
"1052","cue","00:57:28,320","00:57:29,320","Attack it like Tak."
"1053","cue","00:57:30,640","00:57:31,920","-Wow.
-[Tak] Bye, guys."
"1054","cue","00:57:32,000","00:57:33,280","-See you, Tak.
-Bye, Tak."
"1055","cue","00:57:33,360","00:57:34,680","[all] Bye."
"1056","cue","00:57:35,960","00:57:38,360","[Tak]
It's not a good feeling being dumped."
"1057","cue","00:57:38,440","00:57:40,520","I don't think Callum
should still be in the villa."
"1058","cue","00:57:40,600","00:57:44,120","I think he had his shot and he blew it."
"1059","cue","00:57:45,000","00:57:48,640","I did my best, I put my best foot forward
and stayed genuine to myself,"
"1060","cue","00:57:48,720","00:57:50,280","and that's all you can do."
"1061","cue","00:57:50,360","00:57:53,760","If I wasn't their first pick,
then I didn't want to be an option."
"1062","cue","00:57:53,840","00:57:55,280","I'm not second best to anyone."
"1063","cue","00:57:55,360","00:57:59,120","Girls of Australia, stop falling
for fuckboys and stop being stupid."
"1064","cue","00:57:59,200","00:58:00,800","You know, genuine guys are here too."
"1065","cue","00:58:11,120","00:58:12,600","[narrator] <i>Next time…</i>"
"1066","cue","00:58:15,520","00:58:17,320","<i>two new bombs.</i>"
"1067","cue","00:58:17,960","00:58:19,360","Good morning."
"1068","cue","00:58:19,440","00:58:21,080","[Callum] She is banging."
"1069","cue","00:58:21,160","00:58:23,680","There's bombs and bombshells,
but she's a nuke."
"1070","cue","00:58:23,760","00:58:25,520","-Nice to meet ya.
-Hey, Phoebe."
"1071","cue","00:58:25,600","00:58:27,600","[narrator] <i>One massive secret:</i>"
"1072","cue","00:58:27,680","00:58:29,440","<i>They're twins.</i>"
"1073","cue","00:58:29,520","00:58:32,560","Definitely gonna be hard to not give away
that me and Maddy are twins."
"1074","cue","00:58:32,640","00:58:33,920","What do you think of the new chick?"
"1075","cue","00:58:34,000","00:58:35,320","-Good vibe.
-She's a good vibe?"
"1076","cue","00:58:35,400","00:58:36,480","Do you find him hot?"
"1077","cue","00:58:36,560","00:58:38,720","It's so hard to keep a straight face."
"1078","cue","00:58:38,800","00:58:41,440","I'm just trying to remain
absolutely neutral."
"1079","cue","00:58:41,520","00:58:42,760","[narrator] <i>And…</i>"
"1080","cue","00:58:42,840","00:58:44,800","Do you think you'd turn your head?"
"1081","cue","00:58:44,880","00:58:46,840","Are you open to
getting to know other people?"
"1082","cue","00:58:46,920","00:58:48,640","[narrator] <i>…double the drama.</i>"
"1083","cue","00:58:48,720","00:58:50,560","What impression did you give her?"
"1084","cue","00:58:50,640","00:58:52,400","How much reassurance
do I have to give you?"
"1085","cue","00:58:52,480","00:58:54,480","Why are you listening to other people
but not to Al?"
"1086","cue","00:58:54,560","00:58:57,960","This conversation is not even over,
so stop interjecting."
"1087","cue","00:58:58,040","00:59:01,680","No, I'm so sick of it because
you guys are making me out to be a psycho."
