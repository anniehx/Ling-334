"845","cue","00:42:06,520","00:42:08,480","and our energy

in that light when she was with Austen."

and I'm looking at her at the pool,"

as the pool."

"852","cue","00:42:22,200","00:42:23,640","-I kissed so many people.
-Yeah."
"853","cue","00:42:23,720","00:42:24,800","-Yeah. [laughs]
-It's not funny."

looks fade, mate."
"857","cue","00:42:33,520","00:42:36,000","They do, yeah.
There needs to be some substance there."
"858","cue","00:42:36,080","00:42:40,880","But I'm only really initially attracted by
the look, do you know what I mean?"
"859","cue","00:42:40,960","00:42:44,000","Well, I mean, so is everyone.
I feel like it's not just looks."
"860","cue","00:42:44,080","00:42:46,400","I feel like when you say looks,
it's more like…"
"861","cue","00:42:47,040","00:42:48,960","-sexual chemistry.
-Yeah."
"862","cue","00:42:49,040","00:42:50,680","With Layla, my chat, pfft."
"863","cue","00:42:50,760","00:42:52,920","She rocked my socks off.
I didn't know what was happening"
"864","cue","00:42:53,000","00:42:55,760","'cause I was actually interested

"865","cue","00:42:55,840","00:42:57,200","I want to learn more about her."

"868","cue","00:43:02,400","00:43:05,320","I don't know.
It's just-- It is what it's gonna be, eh?"

a little bit confused 'cause, um…"
"876","cue","00:43:29,000","00:43:35,160","I really-- Andre and I have by far
made the strongest connection, um, to me."
"877","cue","00:43:35,240","00:43:37,160","But that's all you've explored too,
isn't it?"

vulnerable and let myself kiss and--"
"880","cue","00:43:44,360","00:43:46,120","-Sort of opened up.
-Yeah, which is good,"
"881","cue","00:43:46,200","00:43:52,240","but I still didn't feel
how I wanted to feel after I did that."
"882","cue","00:43:52,320","00:43:55,640","Yeah, so you were opening the door
and you sort of enjoyed that."
"883","cue","00:43:55,720","00:43:56,720","Now you're sort of like,"
"884","cue","00:43:56,800","00:44:00,520","""Oh, hang on. I've opened myself up.
Do I see this as anything more?"""
"885","cue","00:44:00,600","00:44:03,600","Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly how I felt."

if we're down there tonight,"
"887","cue","00:44:06,720","00:44:09,080","are you just gonna pick
Andre straightaway?"

-Yeah."

""Oh, Jordan."""
"899","cue","00:44:49,720","00:44:52,840","-Like that. Like, you're so nice.
-Yeah, I know."
"900","cue","00:44:53,520","00:44:58,640","I don't know. I was going to choose Andre,
and then Jordan pulled me for a chat,"
