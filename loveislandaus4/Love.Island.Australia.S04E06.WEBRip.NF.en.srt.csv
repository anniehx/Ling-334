-But I've never been to Queenstown."
"169","cue","00:08:13,800","00:08:16,720","She's easy to talk to, man,
and I'm very surprised."
"170","cue","00:08:16,800","00:08:20,880","I didn't think she was this spontaneous
and that's really cool."
"171","cue","00:08:20,960","00:08:22,400","I really like that."
"172","cue","00:08:22,480","00:08:26,480","Also just thinking in my head,
I know he's not into her."
"173","cue","00:08:26,560","00:08:27,880","-[Claudia] Yeah, exactly.
-She's boring."
"174","cue","00:08:27,960","00:08:29,240","Did he tell you that?"
"175","cue","00:08:29,320","00:08:31,480","-Did he tell you--
-Well, he hasn't spoken to her yet,"
"176","cue","00:08:31,560","00:08:33,559","but he was like,
""Look, I'm really happy with you."""
"177","cue","00:08:33,640","00:08:35,600","Obviously she's a good-looking girl,"
"178","cue","00:08:35,679","00:08:38,159","but I know that because she's dry as fuck."
"179","cue","00:08:38,240","00:08:40,320","-She's so boring.
-She is very dry."
"180","cue","00:08:40,400","00:08:43,080","So I just knew from get-go.
He didn't have to tell me."
"181","cue","00:08:43,159","00:08:46,040","'Cause I'm like, I know if I'm your type,
she's not your type."

-Yeah."
"183","cue","00:08:47,440","00:08:50,960","She's not his type. I know his type.
It's me. It's not her."

with you and Phoebe?"
"185","cue","00:08:53,880","00:08:55,280","Me and Phoebe. [chuckles]"

"187","cue","00:08:59,280","00:09:01,840","I'm really happy with her.
I actually really am."
"188","cue","00:09:01,920","00:09:06,280","But, like, we got together
literally the first day, you know, and--"
"189","cue","00:09:06,360","00:09:08,240","You didn't get a chance
to explore your options."
"190","cue","00:09:08,320","00:09:09,320","[Mitchell] No, I didn't."
"191","cue","00:09:09,400","00:09:12,240","I am worried about me
having tunnel vision for Phoebe"
"192","cue","00:09:12,320","00:09:13,880","and only Phoebe,"
"193","cue","00:09:13,960","00:09:16,360","but a new chick has come in the villa,"
"194","cue","00:09:16,440","00:09:19,680","and she may be more than Phoebe."
"195","cue","00:09:19,760","00:09:20,760","We don't know."
"196","cue","00:09:20,840","00:09:24,440","You're literally the first girl
other than Phoebe to pull me for a chat."
"197","cue","00:09:24,520","00:09:25,800","-Oh, wow.
-Like, literally."
"198","cue","00:09:25,880","00:09:28,520","I, respectfully,
will talk to whoever the fuck I want."

-Yeah."
"200","cue","00:09:30,880","00:09:32,640","…and if you don't,
if you shut yourself off,"
"201","cue","00:09:32,720","00:09:35,960","then you're not gonna get anywhere
and you're gonna go home with regrets."
"202","cue","00:09:36,040","00:09:39,360","Yeah. Fuck, no. I want
the full <i>Love Island</i> experience."
"203","cue","00:09:39,440","00:09:40,880","Exactly. And to get that,"
"204","cue","00:09:40,960","00:09:42,720","-you're gonna have to step on toes.
-Yeah."
"205","cue","00:09:42,800","00:09:45,520","For the right guy,
I'm gonna go in all guns blazing."
"206","cue","00:09:45,600","00:09:48,240","Even a slightly open door,
you can still squeeze through."

if I chose you,"
"210","cue","00:10:00,840","00:10:02,440","would you be mad?"
"211","cue","00:10:05,840","00:10:06,840","I wouldn't be angry."
"212","cue","00:10:06,920","00:10:08,680","It is very refreshing"
"213","cue","00:10:08,760","00:10:11,760","that a girl has come
and pulled me for a chat"
"214","cue","00:10:11,840","00:10:13,320","and not worried about Phoebe."
"215","cue","00:10:13,400","00:10:16,440","It feels like I'm kinda doing
what I came here to do."
"216","cue","00:10:20,480","00:10:21,440","So you are open?"

is when they have white dirty shoes."
