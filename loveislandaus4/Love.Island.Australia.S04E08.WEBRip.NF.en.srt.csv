as well, which is quite refreshing, so…"

-Okay, that's nice to hear."

"387","cue","00:19:52,480","00:19:56,600","Yeah, I kind of think it's cute
that I made her blush."
"388","cue","00:19:56,680","00:19:58,160","-You are blushing.
-No, I'm not."
"389","cue","00:19:58,800","00:20:00,960","You go red all the way
around just your face."
"390","cue","00:20:01,040","00:20:04,320","Yeah. Stop. I know. My trainer tells me."
"391","cue","00:20:04,400","00:20:07,160","I just think he's such an idiot
half the time."
"392","cue","00:20:07,240","00:20:10,400","Some of the stupid shit he says,
and then the other half it's like--"
"393","cue","00:20:10,480","00:20:12,840","I like Conor a little bit.
I can't help it."
"394","cue","00:20:12,920","00:20:15,680","We have good banter.
There is more than a friendship there."
"395","cue","00:20:15,760","00:20:18,000","Sometimes you annoy the flying fuck
out of me,"
"396","cue","00:20:18,080","00:20:21,320","and in two seconds I'll be laughing,
'cause I'm like, ""You're such an idiot."""
"397","cue","00:20:21,960","00:20:25,320","And we also haven't kissed
outside of a game either."
"398","cue","00:20:25,400","00:20:28,360","-No, we haven't.
-So, I think something like that would be"
"399","cue","00:20:28,440","00:20:30,160","-a good test to see.
-Do you? Is that what you--"
"400","cue","00:20:30,240","00:20:31,280","I think so, yeah."
"401","cue","00:20:31,360","00:20:34,520","Well, something like that is obviously
the physical touch point of view."
"402","cue","00:20:34,600","00:20:37,000","Yeah. No, I know. Well, yeah."
"403","cue","00:20:41,160","00:20:42,760","Can I kiss you right now?"

"406","cue","00:20:56,880","00:20:58,000","That's cute."
"407","cue","00:20:59,240","00:21:01,320","-I'd give you that much.
-Got to test the theory."
"408","cue","00:21:02,800","00:21:04,320","-So was it? What's the verdict?
-Passed."
"409","cue","00:21:04,400","00:21:05,760","-Passed?

"414","cue","00:21:15,600","00:21:17,160","It was cute."
"415","cue","00:21:17,240","00:21:18,600","-Thank you.
