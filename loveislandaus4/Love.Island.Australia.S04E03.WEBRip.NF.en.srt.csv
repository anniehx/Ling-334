"168","cue","00:10:07,080","00:10:10,720","She's got Conor in the pipeline.
She's got Tak in the pipeline."
"169","cue","00:10:10,800","00:10:14,480","I didn't speak to you or Claudia,
'cause I was with the other girls."
"170","cue","00:10:14,560","00:10:16,120","-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah. That's right."
"171","cue","00:10:16,200","00:10:19,800","-So Tak was full grafting on that. Yeah.
-Grafting it?"
"172","cue","00:10:21,120","00:10:22,760","[Callum] From the moment I walked
in downstairs,"
"173","cue","00:10:22,840","00:10:26,040","like I knew straightaway,
you were my type. Know what I mean?"
"174","cue","00:10:26,120","00:10:27,600","-Yeah.
-For me, you're the hottest."
"175","cue","00:10:27,680","00:10:29,960","And then, like every time you're around,
I'm always laughing."
"176","cue","00:10:30,040","00:10:31,880","-[laughs]
-Because your laughs are contagious."
"177","cue","00:10:31,960","00:10:33,840","[Jess] Yeah. You're so funny."
"178","cue","00:10:33,920","00:10:36,360","I'm just gonna see what happens with Jess"
"179","cue","00:10:36,440","00:10:39,200","because she is ultimately, like,
my top spec bird."
"180","cue","00:10:39,280","00:10:41,000","I didn't think
I would be your type at all."
"181","cue","00:10:41,080","00:10:43,600","Really? Why?
What do you reckon my type would be?"
"182","cue","00:10:43,680","00:10:46,240","Someone like Layla.
I thought that would be your type."
"183","cue","00:10:46,320","00:10:49,880","-Like that blonde, blue eyes. That sort.
-No, I like short, petite girls."
"184","cue","00:10:49,960","00:10:52,120","-Okay, that's me.
-What's your type?"
"185","cue","00:10:52,200","00:10:53,200","-My type?
-Yeah."
"186","cue","00:10:53,280","00:10:55,120","-Is it massive, tattoos…
-You know what?"
"187","cue","00:10:55,200","00:10:56,920","-…and fucking… [grunts]
-[Jess] No."
"188","cue","00:10:57,000","00:10:59,720","It's funny because my type is blond hair…"
"189","cue","00:10:59,800","00:11:00,880","-Is it?
-…blue eyes…"
"190","cue","00:11:00,960","00:11:02,520","-Tick. Tick.
-…rugged."
"191","cue","00:11:02,600","00:11:05,040","-Rugged?
-I've never gone for a pretty boy before."
"192","cue","00:11:05,120","00:11:07,480","-What do you mean by pretty boy?
-You're obviously good-looking."
"193","cue","00:11:07,560","00:11:08,760","Yeah."
"194","cue","00:11:08,840","00:11:12,440","I felt like there was chemistry between
me and Callum when we were talking."
"195","cue","00:11:12,520","00:11:13,560","I'm just giving you the heads up."
"196","cue","00:11:13,640","00:11:16,680","If I was to have the opportunity
to couple up, I would couple up with you."
"197","cue","00:11:16,760","00:11:18,800","-Wow. Okay.
-Yeah. I wouldn't even hesitate."
"198","cue","00:11:18,880","00:11:19,880","That's good to know."
"199","cue","00:11:19,960","00:11:22,040","I'm sorry, brother,
but I'm gonna have to steal Jess."
"200","cue","00:11:22,120","00:11:23,600","-Okay, sorry.
-[groans]"
"201","cue","00:11:23,680","00:11:27,280","I'm just caught into a tornado of boys,
and I'm just spinning and spinning."
"202","cue","00:11:27,360","00:11:29,080","But, actually, I don't want to get out."
"203","cue","00:11:29,160","00:11:31,160","-Thank you. Good chat.
-Good chat."
"204","cue","00:11:31,920","00:11:34,160","-[Jess] How are you?
-[Tak] I'm good. How are you?"
"205","cue","00:11:34,240","00:11:35,240","[Jess] Good."
"206","cue","00:11:35,880","00:11:39,600","The boys that have just come in,
Callum and Tak, they're good blokes."
"207","cue","00:11:39,680","00:11:41,480","But they don't look like me."
"208","cue","00:11:41,560","00:11:44,320","-I definitely vibe with you.
-Yes."
"209","cue","00:11:44,400","00:11:48,120","And I'm keen to get to know you more
and see what you're about, you know?"
"210","cue","00:11:48,200","00:11:50,520","I feel like we have so much in common,"
"211","cue","00:11:50,600","00:11:53,880","-it's like… [chuckles] …it's so…
-[laughs] It's a bit weird."
"212","cue","00:11:53,960","00:11:55,920","-I'm like, ""Where is this coming from?""
-Yeah."
"213","cue","00:11:56,000","00:11:59,320","Jess gives me that energy,
and, uh, we really-- we really connect,"
"214","cue","00:11:59,400","00:12:03,360","so I think I'm gonna have to…
[clicks tongue] …steal her from Conor."
"215","cue","00:12:07,440","00:12:11,400","-Kissing you today, I was like… [groans]
-[laughs] Was I good?"
"216","cue","00:12:11,480","00:12:13,160","-[groans]
-Was I a good kisser?"
"217","cue","00:12:17,600","00:12:19,280","Yeah, you're a good kisser."
"218","cue","00:12:19,360","00:12:21,200","I think you're a good kisser too."
"219","cue","00:12:22,160","00:12:23,280","Am I?"
"220","cue","00:12:24,000","00:12:25,880","-Yeah.
-You think so?"
"221","cue","00:12:25,960","00:12:28,480","-Yeah, you are. [giggles]
-[laughs]"
"222","cue","00:12:29,920","00:12:32,720","Uh, giggling is a sign of nervousness.
Do I make you nervous?"
"223","cue","00:12:32,800","00:12:35,280","[giggles]"
"224","cue","00:12:35,360","00:12:37,600","I actually am a little bit nervous
at the moment."
"225","cue","00:12:39,680","00:12:41,880","-[laughing]
-[giggles]"
"226","cue","00:12:42,560","00:12:43,920","Come here."
"227","cue","00:12:51,920","00:12:54,360","Yeah, we're in. [laughs]"
"228","cue","00:12:57,320","00:12:58,560","-Like that?
-Like that?"
"229","cue","00:12:58,640","00:13:00,600","-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-I was thinking the same."
"230","cue","00:13:19,400","00:13:22,960","[narrator] <i>Here in Spain,</i>
<i>Islander welfare is a top priority.</i>"
"231","cue","00:13:23,040","00:13:26,960","<i>Each Islander has a secret hand signal</i>

"232","cue","00:13:27,040","00:13:28,120","<i>Here, let me show you.</i>"
"233","cue","00:13:28,200","00:13:30,840","<i>Tak, give us the signal if you're okay.</i>"

"236","cue","00:13:40,880","00:13:42,280","Claudia, can we go for a chat?"
"237","cue","00:13:43,520","00:13:44,760","Sure."
"238","cue","00:13:45,800","00:13:47,720","I wanted to pull Claudia aside for a chat"
"239","cue","00:13:47,800","00:13:49,880","only because when we played
the truth or dare game"
"240","cue","00:13:49,960","00:13:51,360","and I shared the kiss with Claudia,"
"241","cue","00:13:51,440","00:13:53,400","to get to understand her a bit more"
"242","cue","00:13:53,480","00:13:55,840","and see where it's at,
like see if the vibes are still there."
"243","cue","00:13:55,920","00:14:00,680","You said up there that I was your type."
"244","cue","00:14:00,760","00:14:02,480","Were you actually--
Were you being serious?"
"245","cue","00:14:02,560","00:14:03,680","-Oh, 100%.
-Really?"
"246","cue","00:14:03,760","00:14:05,960","Did you not see how I acted
when you came in?"
"247","cue","00:14:06,040","00:14:07,840","-Damn.
-[Claudia] And I was telling the girls,"
"248","cue","00:14:07,920","00:14:10,640","I was like, ""I want someone who literally
looks like Aquaman and Harry Styles"
"249","cue","00:14:10,720","00:14:12,320","-or something."" Like literally…
-[Austen laughs]"
"250","cue","00:14:12,400","00:14:13,680","…I said it and then you came in."
"251","cue","00:14:13,760","00:14:15,480","-Fucking hell.
-And then I saw your tattoo."
"252","cue","00:14:15,560","00:14:17,040","-Yeah.
-And I was like,"
"253","cue","00:14:17,120","00:14:18,800","-""This guy is in here for me.""
-What the fuck?"
"254","cue","00:14:18,880","00:14:22,240","There's been such anticipation
with me and Austen,"
"255","cue","00:14:22,320","00:14:27,040","so to-- to actually finally be able
to talk to him was just--"
"256","cue","00:14:27,120","00:14:29,480","It was just such a good feeling."
"257","cue","00:14:29,560","00:14:31,720","It was like, ""Finally!"""
"258","cue","00:14:31,800","00:14:33,760","That's the thing.
You didn't step forward for anyone."
"259","cue","00:14:33,840","00:14:36,120","-But I was going to for you.
-Really?"
"260","cue","00:14:36,200","00:14:38,880","[Claudia] But, Layla, when we were like,
judging you guys…"
"261","cue","00:14:38,960","00:14:41,200","-[Austen] Yeah.
-…she was like, ""No, I like him."""
"262","cue","00:14:41,280","00:14:43,680","So I was like, ""I don't want to fight
with these girls."""
"263","cue","00:14:43,760","00:14:46,160","-Yeah, tread on toes.
-""I'm just gonna play it safe."""
"264","cue","00:14:46,240","00:14:49,200","How do you feel about your situationship?"
"265","cue","00:14:49,280","00:14:54,440","Like we are going really slow
in the sexual stuff."
"266","cue","00:14:54,520","00:14:56,520","-[Tak] As you should.
-[Holly] Yeah, which is good."
"267","cue","00:14:56,600","00:14:58,280","Yeah. Like we haven't even kissed yet."
"268","cue","00:14:58,360","00:15:00,800","-[Tak] Yeah, he told me.
-[sighs] Have you pulled him for a chat?"
"269","cue","00:15:00,880","00:15:03,120","Have you spoken about
the way you want it to go?"
"270","cue","00:15:03,200","00:15:05,520","[Tak] There's the whole taking it slow,
and then there's the whole--"
"271","cue","00:15:05,600","00:15:08,120","-[Holly] Is it stagnant?
-[Tak] Is it just still?"
"272","cue","00:15:08,720","00:15:10,440","You've gotta have
those conversations quickly,"
"273","cue","00:15:10,520","00:15:12,360","'cause you never know what's gonna happen."
"274","cue","00:15:12,440","00:15:15,240","Like at the end of the day,
here, you have to go for things."
"275","cue","00:15:15,320","00:15:17,440","-[Holly] Yeah.
-You have to go for every moment."
"276","cue","00:15:17,520","00:15:19,360","And if you don't start building
something strong,"
"277","cue","00:15:19,440","00:15:20,880","like if you actually are set on him,"
"278","cue","00:15:20,960","00:15:21,960","-go for it.
-Yeah."
"279","cue","00:15:22,800","00:15:24,000","[Austen] The kiss today."
"280","cue","00:15:24,680","00:15:27,560","-Did you, um--
-Wait, with you and me?"
"281","cue","00:15:27,640","00:15:29,080","Yeah."
"282","cue","00:15:29,760","00:15:32,160","[clears throat] Did you feel
anything there?"
"283","cue","00:15:32,240","00:15:33,840","-Yeah.
-Did you?"
"284","cue","00:15:34,480","00:15:36,520","-Wait, did you?
-I did."
"285","cue","00:15:36,600","00:15:39,920","-Are you being serious or are you--
-No, I did. I said it."
"286","cue","00:15:40,000","00:15:42,280","-Have you said that to Layla?
-No, I haven't."
"287","cue","00:15:44,720","00:15:46,640","Yeah, I haven't had a chat with Layla yet."
"288","cue","00:15:46,720","00:15:50,400","There actually was something
when we kissed."
"289","cue","00:15:50,480","00:15:56,160","It was s-- like such a weird
but, like, great feeling."
"290","cue","00:15:56,240","00:15:59,360","But the thing is, w-would you jeopardize
what you have with Jordan?"
"291","cue","00:15:59,440","00:16:01,840","-Is that something you'd be interested in?
-Yeah."
"292","cue","00:16:03,680","00:16:05,800","Without beating around the bush,
yeah. [laughs]"
"293","cue","00:16:06,480","00:16:08,120","-Okay.
-I'm never this forward,"
"294","cue","00:16:08,200","00:16:10,000","but in this place, you have to be forward."
"295","cue","00:16:10,080","00:16:11,920","-You have to.
-And I'm not doing it anymore."
"296","cue","00:16:12,000","00:16:14,440","I'm not beating around the fucking bush.
I'm sick of it."
"297","cue","00:16:14,520","00:16:17,360","Would you consider getting to know
someone else?"
"298","cue","00:16:17,440","00:16:20,600","Like in all honesty,
I'm only really attracted to you or Layla."
"299","cue","00:16:21,320","00:16:24,120","It's a bit of an issue.
I don't know if I should jeopardize that."
"300","cue","00:16:24,200","00:16:26,160","I like Layla and Claudia."
"301","cue","00:16:26,240","00:16:28,560","Currently, right now, again,
Layla does have the edge,"
"302","cue","00:16:28,640","00:16:30,440","because I just--
I get along with her so well."
"303","cue","00:16:30,520","00:16:33,280","Uh, but you can tell a lot by kiss."
"304","cue","00:16:33,360","00:16:38,600","And I did feel it today
when I shared the kiss with Claudia."
"305","cue","00:16:38,680","00:16:41,880","I think, um, that was a good chat."
"306","cue","00:16:41,960","00:16:44,440","I'm ready to go back.
I'm gonna talk to Layla as well tonight."
"307","cue","00:16:44,520","00:16:46,920","-Yeah, no shit.
-Mmm."
"308","cue","00:16:47,000","00:16:48,120","-Let's go.
-So, yeah."
"309","cue","00:16:48,200","00:16:50,560","-That was a good chat, though.
-Yeah. [chuckles]"
"310","cue","00:16:50,640","00:16:52,600","-'Cause we actually spoke.
-[Austen] I know."
"311","cue","00:16:55,560","00:16:57,240","Are you sure
they're not still in the tepee?"
"312","cue","00:16:57,320","00:16:58,480","Oh, they fucking are."
"313","cue","00:16:59,520","00:17:03,160","I'm so confused. I don't-- I don't
know what to do. Um…"
"314","cue","00:17:03,960","00:17:05,000","Yeah."
"315","cue","00:17:05,560","00:17:07,520","Did you get a bit nervous around her?"
"316","cue","00:17:08,160","00:17:09,720","-A little bit.
-That's a good sign."
"317","cue","00:17:09,800","00:17:10,960","I know. Yeah, for sure."
"318","cue","00:17:11,040","00:17:13,240","-Claudia is beautiful.
-[Callum] Yeah, she's hot."
"319","cue","00:17:13,319","00:17:15,920","But I get along more with Layla."
"320","cue","00:17:16,000","00:17:18,119","Partly the reason why
I didn't want to go--"
"321","cue","00:17:18,200","00:17:19,800","I was trying to make excuses."
"322","cue","00:17:19,880","00:17:24,880","That was why I didn't want to go talk
to Claudia 'cause I was like, ""I know…"
"323","cue","00:17:25,880","00:17:28,160","I know that she is gonna like me,"
"324","cue","00:17:28,240","00:17:30,400","and I feel like I'm gonna reciprocate
that same energy."""
"325","cue","00:17:30,480","00:17:32,480","Yeah, better be fucking careful, bro."
"326","cue","00:17:32,560","00:17:36,960","Because if-- if-- if you
like burn bridges with Layla…"
"327","cue","00:17:37,040","00:17:38,760","-Yeah.
-…then you're on shit street."
"328","cue","00:17:38,840","00:17:41,800","But at the same time, if you're not vibing
with Layla, you're wasting your time."
"329","cue","00:17:41,880","00:17:44,120","You need to just fucking--
It's either A or B."
"330","cue","00:17:44,200","00:17:46,720","-It's a fucked situation because she--
-It is fucked."
"331","cue","00:17:46,800","00:17:49,040","It's fucked from all angles.
It's like orgy fucked."

-Yeah."

"933","cue","00:48:16,560","00:48:18,760","but you couldn't even give me
the time of day to chat."
"934","cue","00:48:18,840","00:48:22,320","But you also have to understand
I was just, like, nervous, shy."
"935","cue","00:48:22,400","00:48:24,800","So you're still nervous and shy around me?"
"936","cue","00:48:25,920","00:48:27,960","-Is that a bad thing?
-No, I'm just asking."
"937","cue","00:48:28,040","00:48:29,840","-Well, yeah.
-Okay."
"938","cue","00:48:30,840","00:48:32,920","[sighs] So, like…"

"944","cue","00:48:43,480","00:48:46,480","Like-- Just being, like, left in the dark,
so it's like--"
"945","cue","00:48:46,560","00:48:48,480","I felt like I was respecting you"
"946","cue","00:48:48,560","00:48:53,280","by obviously, like, thinking
we had something going on"
"947","cue","00:48:53,360","00:48:55,920","and, like, you know, focusing on you."
"948","cue","00:48:56,000","00:48:58,560","And then being in a bed with Holly,"
"949","cue","00:48:58,640","00:49:00,520","-it's hard like that.
-[Claudia] Yeah."
"950","cue","00:49:00,600","00:49:04,680","But respecting you by thinking
we were still running smoothly."
"951","cue","00:49:04,760","00:49:06,440","I've thought that this entire time."
"952","cue","00:49:06,520","00:49:08,520","I did not know I was gonna get along
with Austen."
"953","cue","00:49:08,600","00:49:11,240","But I just feel like
you could have chatted to me about it."
"954","cue","00:49:11,320","00:49:12,760","I know, but I'm chatting to you now."
"955","cue","00:49:12,840","00:49:15,960","-So let's, like, get past that.
-Yeah, well, I think we are."
"956","cue","00:49:16,040","00:49:19,320","So how-- Did you think your talks
were friendship-level?"
"957","cue","00:49:19,400","00:49:23,120","No. It was, like, definitely like--"
"958","cue","00:49:23,200","00:49:24,680","There could be something."
"959","cue","00:49:24,760","00:49:27,120","And I think the challenge
changed a lot for me as well."
"960","cue","00:49:27,200","00:49:29,200","-Why's that?
-Because…"
"961","cue","00:49:30,040","00:49:32,960","[sigh] …he said stuff
that was very, like, me."
"962","cue","00:49:33,040","00:49:37,560","Like, the Harry Styles thing was weird.
And then we had a kiss which was nice."
"963","cue","00:49:38,120","00:49:40,360","I'm not going to lie
and say there's no connection with Austen,"
"964","cue","00:49:40,440","00:49:42,440","-'cause there is.
-Yeah. Yeah."
"965","cue","00:49:45,880","00:49:49,680","So, the moral of the story is
you're getting along with Austen."
"966","cue","00:49:49,760","00:49:52,160","-You want to explore that.
-Absolutely."
"967","cue","00:49:53,440","00:49:55,960","One minute, it's, uh,
sunshine and rainbows."
"968","cue","00:49:56,600","00:49:59,160","And then the next minute,
it's an absolute fucking storm."
"969","cue","00:50:12,160","00:50:15,200","Wow. I did not see that coming."
"970","cue","00:50:15,280","00:50:16,960","And talking of coming…"

is what's not, like, making me pursue it."
"977","cue","00:50:40,640","00:50:42,080","[Claudia] I think
Austen's playing it safe."
