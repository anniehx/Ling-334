fucking wrong shit tonight."

"83","cue","00:04:26,920","00:04:29,080","-I feel he didn't do it intentionally.
-[Phoebe H.] Have you met him?"

Have you met him?"

outside of here, when I'm here?"

That's all it was, Claudia."

At the end of the day-- No, listen--"
"93","cue","00:04:54,440","00:04:56,680","-You are ridiculous.
-No, listen. Okay."
"94","cue","00:04:56,760","00:05:03,360","I am so frustrated that Austen is not
seeing that Callum is the instigator."
"95","cue","00:05:03,440","00:05:06,040","He is a fucking shit stirrer
and I'm fucking sick of it."
"96","cue","00:05:06,120","00:05:08,760","-Okay.
-And if you want to continue being like,"

and watch that"

-Okay?"

'cause I'm done talking right now. Okay?"
"104","cue","00:05:28,880","00:05:32,800","-Go talk to that idiot. Okay?
-Okay."
"105","cue","00:06:00,320","00:06:02,880","[Austen] I think Claudia definitely has
a right to be this angry at Callum."
"106","cue","00:06:02,960","00:06:06,880","This was also my fault.
And I definitely can take blame for it."
"107","cue","00:06:06,960","00:06:09,240","I think I should have done it myself."
"108","cue","00:06:12,920","00:06:14,280","[Austen] Okay, boys."
"109","cue","00:06:14,360","00:06:18,920","First things first, I appreciate you guys
doing that all for me. But it's my thing."
"110","cue","00:06:19,000","00:06:22,600","This should have been me talking
to Jason and hearing it for myself."
"111","cue","00:06:22,680","00:06:24,760","-So, where's your head at now?
-I'm fine."
"112","cue","00:06:24,840","00:06:27,440","Have you spoke to Claudia and said,
""Don't you think I should have known about"

-Yeah. I get that."

it didn't really bother me that much."

-Leave the baggage."
"116","cue","00:06:34,880","00:06:37,400","-Leave the baggage.
-But the baggage has knocked on the door."

-Basically, yeah. [laughing]"
"118","cue","00:06:39,080","00:06:41,240","That's actually really good.
That was really good."
"119","cue","00:06:41,320","00:06:44,680","And I understand that, and I think
I should have taken more initiative."
"120","cue","00:06:44,760","00:06:46,080","-It's all settled, bro.
-[Mitchell] Yeah."
"121","cue","00:06:46,160","00:06:48,960","There's nothing to worry about.
I've got complete trust in Claudia."

"123","cue","00:06:50,600","00:06:53,120","and I was very much in the wrong
'cause I didn't stop you."
"124","cue","00:06:53,200","00:06:54,840","-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Austen] Okay?"
"125","cue","00:06:54,920","00:06:56,760","-[Austen] All squashed? All done?

"169","cue","00:09:09,240","00:09:11,720","I thought it was a joke.
I thought you'd find that joke funny."
"170","cue","00:09:11,800","00:09:13,280","Oh, you think that's funny."
"171","cue","00:09:13,360","00:09:15,360","I thought it would make you laugh."
"172","cue","00:09:15,440","00:09:19,800","You think that I'd find that funny
after the chat that we had today?"
"173","cue","00:09:20,840","00:09:25,080","Oh. Okay. Yeah, I don't know.
Look, I'm sorry I made that joke."
"174","cue","00:09:25,160","00:09:27,680","No. I'm so sick of hearing you say sorry."
"175","cue","00:09:29,160","00:09:31,320","Because you're not learning from it, Al."
"176","cue","00:09:31,400","00:09:32,560","Oh."
"177","cue","00:09:32,640","00:09:35,120","I don't know.
I just feel like maybe you are immature."
"178","cue","00:09:35,200","00:09:36,320","Oh."
"179","cue","00:09:36,400","00:09:39,240","Do you think
that makes our connection look good?"
"180","cue","00:09:39,320","00:09:42,120","Or do you think
it makes our connection look weak?"
"181","cue","00:09:42,200","00:09:45,800","-You look accessible, Al.
-What's accessible?"
"182","cue","00:09:45,880","00:09:48,760","-Girls think that they can go for you.
-Why would they think that?"
"183","cue","00:09:48,840","00:09:52,440","Because you say stuff like that
to make it look like you're available."
"184","cue","00:09:53,080","00:09:53,880","Oh."
"185","cue","00:09:53,960","00:09:56,680","I don't think that's funny.
I think that's disrespectful."
"186","cue","00:09:56,760","00:09:58,120","I'm sitting right next to you."
"187","cue","00:09:58,200","00:10:01,280","You know that I like you,
you know I have feelings for you,"
"188","cue","00:10:01,360","00:10:03,800","and you just
made me look like a complete mug."
"189","cue","00:10:04,560","00:10:08,680","[clears throat] Look, I'm sorry
I made the joke. I'm gonna learn from it."
"190","cue","00:10:08,760","00:10:09,680","No, you're not."
"191","cue","00:10:09,760","00:10:12,920","I don't really have much faith
that you are gonna learn."
"192","cue","00:10:13,000","00:10:14,640","I just think you need to grow a pair."
"193","cue","00:10:14,720","00:10:16,400","I think you need to grow up"
"194","cue","00:10:16,480","00:10:19,400","and I think you need to understand
what commitment actually is."
"195","cue","00:10:29,040","00:10:30,640","[Al clears throat]"
"196","cue","00:10:30,720","00:10:35,800","Al making that comment has showed me
that I should not trust him."
"197","cue","00:10:35,880","00:10:37,880","If he's gonna make
those comments about his ex,"
"198","cue","00:10:37,960","00:10:40,120","then what is gonna do
on the outside world?"
"199","cue","00:10:40,200","00:10:43,320","No way.
As if I'm gonna trust him after that."
"200","cue","00:10:43,400","00:10:46,000","-I feel like I'm fucking babysitting.
-[Phoebe] I know."
"201","cue","00:10:46,080","00:10:47,680","[Jess] I don't want to be a goddamn coach."
"202","cue","00:10:47,760","00:10:50,400","[Jess] I want him to know
what he should and shouldn't say."
"203","cue","00:10:50,480","00:10:53,240","Do you think that crossed the line?
Or do you think I'm overreacting?"
"204","cue","00:10:53,320","00:10:54,520","No, I think it crossed the line."
"205","cue","00:10:54,600","00:10:57,400","Especially because he's done it
multiple times."
"206","cue","00:10:57,480","00:10:59,120","And you've obviously
already had a chat about it."
"207","cue","00:10:59,200","00:11:00,960","[Jess] We had a chat
about it literally today."
"208","cue","00:11:01,040","00:11:03,680","Thing is, he didn't even realize
he said that until you were like…"
"209","cue","00:11:03,760","00:11:05,400","-Until I fucking stormed off.
-Yeah."
"210","cue","00:11:05,480","00:11:06,880","-He thought it was fine.
-Yeah."
"211","cue","00:11:06,960","00:11:08,760","He's so fucking dumb."
"212","cue","00:11:08,840","00:11:12,000","-But I don't want to date someone dumb.
-Yeah."
"213","cue","00:11:12,080","00:11:15,320","Yesterday was perfectly fine, great,
real lovey-dovey."
"214","cue","00:11:15,400","00:11:19,000","She goes on the date, comes back,
acts all macho like,"
"215","cue","00:11:19,080","00:11:21,480","""You do this wrong, he does this,
you're not this."""
"216","cue","00:11:22,400","00:11:24,520","-Say, ""Then what are you still doing?""
-[Al] You do all these things."
"217","cue","00:11:24,600","00:11:27,800","You joke too much, blah, blah, blah.
I'm like, where has this come from?"
"218","cue","00:11:27,880","00:11:30,320","-She's had a week and a half to--
-Why are you telling me--"
"219","cue","00:11:30,400","00:11:32,040","All of a sudden,
she goes on a date with this guy"
"220","cue","00:11:32,120","00:11:33,960","-and then she's trying to pick you apart.
-[Al] Yeah."
"221","cue","00:11:34,040","00:11:36,200","[Mitchell] Yeah, it's a bit weird
that it's taken a week and a half."
"222","cue","00:11:36,280","00:11:38,440","And all of this coming up now,
after the date, all this."
"223","cue","00:11:38,520","00:11:39,920","True colors are coming through now."
"224","cue","00:11:40,000","00:11:44,520","You know, a couple days before,
we were saying crazy jokes to each other."
"225","cue","00:11:44,600","00:11:46,080","Crossing a line here,
crossing a line there,"
"226","cue","00:11:46,160","00:11:49,400","and we laughed about it.
That's brang us closer together."
"227","cue","00:11:49,480","00:11:51,600","And then suddenly, a new guy comes in,"
"228","cue","00:11:51,680","00:11:54,480","she really starts
faulting the relationship here."
"229","cue","00:11:54,560","00:11:57,560","Girls almost look for a reason
to start something,"
"230","cue","00:11:57,640","00:12:01,720","so, to see if you'll run after them
and see if they're okay, and it's like--"
"231","cue","00:12:01,800","00:12:02,880","It's almost like a test."
"232","cue","00:12:02,960","00:12:04,640","See if you're that keen,
if you're gonna work for her."
"233","cue","00:12:04,720","00:12:07,320","If you're gonna go back and run after her."
"234","cue","00:12:07,400","00:12:09,200","Don't run after her."
"235","cue","00:12:09,280","00:12:12,760","{\an8}You're too sexy to be chasing birds -
they chase us."
"236","cue","00:12:14,400","00:12:16,320","I don't even
want to sleep in a bed with him."

pushed my buttons."

I'm sick of your shit."

trouble communicating, opening up."
"331","cue","00:16:35,560","00:16:39,840","[Al] I'm not one to talk about feelings.
I think that's where I struggled a bit."
"332","cue","00:16:39,920","00:16:41,360","I did-- I really like her."
"333","cue","00:16:41,440","00:16:44,320","I do still feel like I want to
make things work right with her."
"334","cue","00:16:44,400","00:16:48,760","And I do see, though,
something outside the villa with her."
"335","cue","00:16:48,840","00:16:51,440","If she's a good girl,
and you know you want her,"
"336","cue","00:16:51,520","00:16:52,760","take the good with the bad."
"337","cue","00:16:52,840","00:16:54,400","She is worth waiting for, and I--"
"338","cue","00:16:55,280","00:16:57,680","I will speak to her and see how it goes."
"339","cue","00:16:57,760","00:16:59,200","-You got this, Al.
-[Austen] Good."
"340","cue","00:16:59,840","00:17:05,240","Now I've realized what I need to do.
And that is to talk more openly with Jess."
"341","cue","00:17:05,839","00:17:07,040","Do you wanna have a chat now?"
"342","cue","00:17:07,119","00:17:08,560","Yeah. That okay?"
"343","cue","00:17:08,640","00:17:10,240","Yeah. Where do you wanna go?"
"344","cue","00:17:11,319","00:17:13,160","I'm not doing any talking. I'm tired."
"345","cue","00:17:13,240","00:17:15,440","Obviously, there's a different side to you
I've seen today."
"346","cue","00:17:16,240","00:17:19,400","And I probably brought it out of you,
but I feel like--"
"347","cue","00:17:19,480","00:17:22,240","I think we're a little bit different.
Because I don't get angry, Jess."
"348","cue","00:17:22,319","00:17:26,240","I don't really, like, express my feelings,
like, at a point like that."
"349","cue","00:17:26,319","00:17:29,320","[stammers]
I don't want you to baby me as well."
"350","cue","00:17:30,000","00:17:31,480","No. I don't want that either."
"351","cue","00:17:31,560","00:17:33,080","I don't want you to teach me anything."
"352","cue","00:17:33,160","00:17:35,480","Also, I don't have the patience anymore."
"353","cue","00:17:35,560","00:17:37,520","[stammers] I'm 26."
"354","cue","00:17:37,600","00:17:38,720","I'm single."
"355","cue","00:17:38,800","00:17:41,000","And I'm tired. I want--"
"356","cue","00:17:41,080","00:17:44,400","I expect you to just know these things.
These things are common sense, Al."
"357","cue","00:17:44,880","00:17:48,520","These are not things that
you should be learning at 26."
"358","cue","00:17:48,600","00:17:50,480","It's something that
you should already know."
"359","cue","00:17:51,120","00:17:55,080","I think if you like a person, there just
needs to be that level of respect."
"360","cue","00:17:55,160","00:17:57,000","You know,
you're going to get confrontation."
"361","cue","00:17:57,080","00:17:58,960","-Yeah.
-If you don't like confrontation,"
"362","cue","00:17:59,040","00:18:02,120","or you want no part of it,
then stay single."
"363","cue","00:18:06,000","00:18:07,520","Mmm. Yeah. Okay."
"364","cue","00:18:07,600","00:18:11,400","When you date someone,
you get the good side and you get the bad."
"365","cue","00:18:12,320","00:18:15,800","And it's up to you if you want to
take all of it, or you take none of it."
"366","cue","00:18:15,880","00:18:17,320","You don't just get one."
"367","cue","00:18:17,400","00:18:18,400","Yeah."
"368","cue","00:18:18,480","00:18:20,520","It's hard to navigate
and really know what to do."
"369","cue","00:18:20,600","00:18:22,160","Uh, the dos and don'ts."
"370","cue","00:18:22,240","00:18:26,400","People feel that you think
that I'm wrapped around your finger."
"371","cue","00:18:26,480","00:18:29,800","I don't like that. I don't want you
to think that you're invincible."
"372","cue","00:18:29,880","00:18:33,680","Because there are people in here
who already know these things"
"373","cue","00:18:33,760","00:18:37,080","that you don't know,
who want to get to know me."
"374","cue","00:18:37,160","00:18:39,880","And I'm just gonna say it now."
"375","cue","00:18:39,960","00:18:41,960","If you don't clean your act up…"
"376","cue","00:18:43,360","00:18:46,800","that's it,
I'm going to open the door more."
"377","cue","00:18:46,880","00:18:48,000","Yeah. [sighs]"
"378","cue","00:18:53,600","00:18:55,600","{\an8}I'll take everything on board
that you've said."
"379","cue","00:18:55,680","00:18:58,040","{\an8}I promise that, Jess."
"380","cue","00:18:58,120","00:19:01,400","I just want you and your whole you
of who you are. Okay?"
"381","cue","00:19:01,480","00:19:05,000","No matter if you're angry or what.
I'm still gonna keep trying for you, so…"
"382","cue","00:19:05,080","00:19:07,360","-Okay. All right.
-I just want you to know that."
"383","cue","00:19:07,440","00:19:10,520","Jess and I have a lot to work on. Um…"
"384","cue","00:19:10,600","00:19:13,120","There's still probably red flags
that I have and that she has,"
"385","cue","00:19:13,200","00:19:17,080","but at the end of the day I do believe
that Jess has something special"
"386","cue","00:19:17,160","00:19:19,360","that I've never met
any other girl that has."
"387","cue","00:19:20,200","00:19:22,440","I've never felt this way before. Shit."
"388","cue","00:19:24,920","00:19:27,280","It's a weird, like,
sinking feeling in your heart."
"389","cue","00:19:28,440","00:19:30,760","And you're a big part of my life."
"390","cue","00:19:32,920","00:19:33,920","Yeah."
"391","cue","00:19:40,960","00:19:44,120","I'll never meet a person like you
that makes me laugh as much as you."
"392","cue","00:19:44,200","00:19:48,240","I think you're worth fighting for,
so that's why I wanna keep trying."
"393","cue","00:19:48,320","00:19:49,760","[chuckles] All right. Come here."
"394","cue","00:20:18,320","00:20:20,600","Do you think you're gonna like this place?"
"395","cue","00:20:21,560","00:20:22,800","We'll see."
"396","cue","00:20:22,880","00:20:23,880","[exhales heavily]"
"397","cue","00:20:24,440","00:20:25,840","Should I get naked?"
"398","cue","00:20:25,920","00:20:28,160","-Don't, Jason.
-[chuckles]"
"399","cue","00:20:28,240","00:20:30,640","{\an8}You just love to stir shit up, don't you?"
"400","cue","00:20:30,720","00:20:34,840","It's very uncomfortable having your ex…
[chuckles]"
"401","cue","00:20:34,920","00:20:37,640","…right there when you're
trying to sleep with your new man."
"402","cue","00:20:43,680","00:20:44,840","[Jess] I really like you."
"403","cue","00:20:44,920","00:20:46,720","And that part's scary."
"404","cue","00:20:46,800","00:20:48,240","You know I do too."
"405","cue","00:20:49,200","00:20:53,600","That's why I got so upset tonight.
Because I feel like I'm in pretty deep."
"406","cue","00:20:53,680","00:20:57,360","I know that if I took you home,
my family would fall for you."
"407","cue","00:20:57,920","00:20:59,640","Like, they really would."

a butterfly came"

like did a couple of little spins"
"685","cue","00:33:53,280","00:33:55,240","and then flew out and, you know, I said,"
"686","cue","00:33:55,320","00:33:57,760","that's sort of the nature feeling,
our energy,"
"687","cue","00:33:57,840","00:33:59,680","that us boys were bringing to the table."
"688","cue","00:33:59,760","00:34:02,600","Talk about something where you

"703","cue","00:34:41,400","00:34:44,280","What makes me feel sad is when I fail."
"704","cue","00:34:44,360","00:34:46,960","And if I go out on, say, a Saturday
and I'm hungover on Sunday"
"705","cue","00:34:47,040","00:34:50,120","and I don't meet a prep,
or I'm not giving 100% to my clients,"
"706","cue","00:34:50,199","00:34:51,199","that makes me feel sad"
"707","cue","00:34:51,280","00:34:53,520","'cause I feel like I'm doing a shit job
and I'm better than that."
"708","cue","00:34:54,360","00:34:56,880","Probably, like, every day
I feel sad at least once,"
"709","cue","00:34:56,960","00:35:00,240","and usually it's just like in
the first part of the day when I wake up."
"710","cue","00:35:00,320","00:35:01,720","Whoa."
"711","cue","00:35:03,400","00:35:04,680","-I just--

"714","cue","00:35:08,680","00:35:11,040","-That's when I feel sad.
-[Tak] Heavy."
"715","cue","00:35:11,120","00:35:12,360","[Tak] It got heavy real quick."
"716","cue","00:35:12,440","00:35:15,240","At the start, I thought
it was going to be a ""piss-take."""
"717","cue","00:35:15,320","00:35:17,840","But we got into it and, honestly,
I think it was awesome."
"718","cue","00:35:17,920","00:35:19,280","I want to do that at least once a week."
"719","cue","00:35:19,360","00:35:21,200","[Callum] I feel empowered.
I know what women mean."
"720","cue","00:35:21,280","00:35:22,720","[Callum] Now I feel empowered."
"721","cue","00:35:22,800","00:35:26,000","Jordan did very well at organizing that.
I was very shocked."
"722","cue","00:35:26,080","00:35:31,120","Not shocked that he wasn't capable of it,
but shocked that he got us all to open up."
"723","cue","00:35:31,200","00:35:32,880","And it was amazing. It was good."

He has an insane body."

left with my pants down."

that has ever come back."
"908","cue","00:43:48,000","00:43:50,400","I think so, yeah.
First winner, as well, come back."
"909","cue","00:43:50,480","00:43:51,680","Weird as, yeah."

I played for North Melbourne, Essendon,"

"922","cue","00:44:15,640","00:44:19,120","Mate, it was good. We fed donkeys.
Random as, yeah."
"923","cue","00:44:19,200","00:44:20,800","And then had a wine and that,
and then, yeah,"
"924","cue","00:44:20,880","00:44:23,960","had a little kiss at the end,

I'm not gonna lie."

"933","cue","00:44:43,400","00:44:46,120","Especially, just to sit there
and, like, not have to think."
"934","cue","00:44:46,200","00:44:47,520","It was so easy to chat with him."
"935","cue","00:44:47,600","00:44:48,960","-That's a good sign.
-That's good."
"936","cue","00:44:49,040","00:44:52,640","I know. It was so easy for me to sit there
and flirt with him, and be cheeky."
"937","cue","00:44:52,720","00:44:54,520","There were heaps of chemistry
and it was fun."

I like a really good rig, athletic."

with, like, light-colored eyes."
"941","cue","00:45:08,760","00:45:10,760","Yeah, he is my exact type."
"942","cue","00:45:11,400","00:45:14,200","That was good to get out of the villa.
It was good to just like--"
"943","cue","00:45:14,280","00:45:15,840","You know, the whole thing was amazing."
"944","cue","00:45:15,920","00:45:20,280","Like, I really enjoyed it,
and it's very interesting,"
"945","cue","00:45:20,360","00:45:22,600","but we'll just see what happens."
"946","cue","00:45:22,680","00:45:24,920","Mitchy boy is in trouble."
"947","cue","00:45:25,000","00:45:27,640","I feel like Mitch is more her type."
"948","cue","00:45:27,720","00:45:32,880","Like, he was an ex-AFL player,
and Phoebe loves AFL players."
"949","cue","00:45:33,400","00:45:36,160","I don't want
to completely close myself off to the idea"
"950","cue","00:45:36,240","00:45:40,200","because this is the first bomb that's also
come in where I've actually felt this way."
"951","cue","00:45:40,280","00:45:42,600","-Yeah.
-I haven't had this with the other bombs."
"952","cue","00:45:42,680","00:45:44,760","This is my first real test."
"953","cue","00:45:49,560","00:45:55,440","If my Mitchy boy was not in the picture,
I'd be full steam ahead on this Mitch."
"954","cue","00:45:55,520","00:45:58,520","Like, he's my type to a T.
Like, we had good chats."

"999","cue","00:48:02,480","00:48:04,400","-[gasps]
-Wow, look at the size of this guy."
"1000","cue","00:48:04,480","00:48:05,680","[Claudia] What the fuck is going on?"
"1001","cue","00:48:06,360","00:48:07,560","Is he coming down here?"
"1002","cue","00:48:07,640","00:48:09,720","And all us boys are just like--"
"1003","cue","00:48:09,800","00:48:12,840","[Al] Dropping the sunglasses,
going, ""Oh, my goodness."""
"1004","cue","00:48:12,920","00:48:16,280","[Jordan] Fucking hell. Put it away."
"1005","cue","00:48:16,360","00:48:18,080","It's too hot to wear clothes."
"1006","cue","00:48:18,160","00:48:21,160","He's going straight down to the girls.
Fucking hell."
"1007","cue","00:48:21,240","00:48:24,280","All right, boys. Wish me luck. [laughs]"
"1008","cue","00:48:24,360","00:48:27,040","-Oh!
-[wolf-whistling]"
"1009","cue","00:48:27,120","00:48:30,400","[screams]"
"1010","cue","00:48:31,120","00:48:33,320","[Phoebe H] My mouth was to the floor."
"1011","cue","00:48:34,000","00:48:36,400","What are you doing? It's already hot here."
"1012","cue","00:48:36,480","00:48:38,320","I don't know what to do. [chuckles]"
"1013","cue","00:48:38,400","00:48:40,360","-Jess, let's go for a chat.
-[all laughing]"
"1014","cue","00:48:40,440","00:48:41,400","Let's go."
"1015","cue","00:48:41,480","00:48:43,240","-Good start.
-Let's go."
"1016","cue","00:48:43,320","00:48:47,200","Mitch pulled me for a chat first.
I mean, look at me, ten out of ten."
"1017","cue","00:48:47,280","00:48:49,560","[laughs] Did you fall? [laughing]"
"1018","cue","00:48:49,640","00:48:51,800","[all shouting, laughing]"
"1019","cue","00:48:51,880","00:48:53,520","Oh, my-- Oh, my God."
"1020","cue","00:48:53,600","00:48:55,320","[all laughing]"
"1021","cue","00:48:55,400","00:48:57,600","He hates it. He hates it."
"1022","cue","00:48:57,680","00:49:00,040","None of this ""walk up the stairs."""
"1023","cue","00:49:00,120","00:49:03,880","He wants to fricking pick her up,
and I have to watch all this happen."
"1024","cue","00:49:03,960","00:49:07,200","I'm just gonna dive into it.
What's your type of guy that you go for?"
"1025","cue","00:49:07,280","00:49:10,040","I'm not a very serious person,
very lighthearted."
"1026","cue","00:49:10,120","00:49:11,680","-I like to have a laugh.
-Yeah."
"1027","cue","00:49:11,760","00:49:14,040","I just want someone
who doesn't take himself seriously."
"1028","cue","00:49:14,120","00:49:15,640","I'm the exact same. I need that."
"1029","cue","00:49:15,720","00:49:18,040","'Cause I don't take myself serious.
I'm just a clown."
"1030","cue","00:49:18,120","00:49:20,640","-You can already see how I just--
-Yeah. I like that."
"1031","cue","00:49:20,720","00:49:22,440","-That's funny. You know what I mean?
-Yeah."
"1032","cue","00:49:22,520","00:49:25,000","That's like--
You can sometimes get yourself in trouble,"
"1033","cue","00:49:25,080","00:49:27,120","but I'm here to put myself first,
and that's what I'm going to do."
"1034","cue","00:49:27,200","00:49:29,000","I don't really care
about stepping on toes."
"1035","cue","00:49:29,080","00:49:31,880","I'm just confident
that whatever happens, happens."
"1036","cue","00:49:31,960","00:49:33,440","Of course you are, but look at you."
"1037","cue","00:49:33,520","00:49:35,000","[both laughing]"
"1038","cue","00:49:35,080","00:49:36,680","[Jess] Of course you're confident."
"1039","cue","00:49:36,760","00:49:39,640","-But you know that already. Yeah, you do.
-Yeah, maybe."
"1040","cue","00:49:39,720","00:49:41,280","What an absolute weapon."
"1041","cue","00:49:41,360","00:49:45,440","He's got the best body in the villa.
I couldn't believe it. It looked fake."
"1042","cue","00:49:45,520","00:49:47,520","-I'm excited for you for tonight.
-You are?"
"1043","cue","00:49:47,600","00:49:49,000","-Yeah.
-Who knows what's in store?"
"1044","cue","00:49:49,080","00:49:51,600","-Yeah, like--
-Did you see my first night last year?"
"1045","cue","00:49:52,120","00:49:54,720","-Yeah, you kissed all the girls.
-[both laughing]"
"1046","cue","00:49:54,800","00:49:57,720","-I'm gonna have to do that again.
-Do it."
"1047","cue","00:49:57,800","00:50:00,240","I might have to.
That would seriously spice it up."
"1048","cue","00:50:00,320","00:50:01,760","-Yeah.
-Maybe. We'll see."
"1049","cue","00:50:01,840","00:50:03,200","-Yeah.
-We'll see."
"1050","cue","00:50:03,280","00:50:05,240","-I have a ques--
-Why? Would you kiss me back?"
"1051","cue","00:50:05,320","00:50:06,360","Well-- I mean--"
"1052","cue","00:50:06,440","00:50:08,200","[both laughing]"
"1053","cue","00:50:08,280","00:50:11,200","Um… [laughs]"
"1054","cue","00:50:11,280","00:50:14,160","I don't even know if I could reach Mitch
if he tried to kiss me."
"1055","cue","00:50:14,240","00:50:18,040","I think I'd need to get
a 12-foot stepladder to get to the top."
"1056","cue","00:50:18,120","00:50:21,000","-[Tak] This guy's chiseled, bro.
-[laughs]"
"1057","cue","00:50:21,080","00:50:22,080","What's going on?"
"1058","cue","00:50:22,160","00:50:24,640","-Okay, who's next?
-You okay? You all right?"
"1059","cue","00:50:24,720","00:50:26,640","[all laughing]"
"1060","cue","00:50:26,720","00:50:29,120","-[Al] You've gotta relax.
-[laughing continues]"
"1061","cue","00:50:29,200","00:50:31,120","-Do you wanna go for a chat?
-I'd love to."
"1062","cue","00:50:31,800","00:50:32,920","Mmm!"
"1063","cue","00:50:33,000","00:50:35,480","-You gotta come in confident.
-[Tak] Yeah, exactly. For sure."
"1064","cue","00:50:35,560","00:50:37,440","[Callum] I definitely have
some competition."
"1065","cue","00:50:37,520","00:50:39,720","I'll have to rely on my chat
'cause he's definitely bigger than me."
"1066","cue","00:50:39,800","00:50:42,400","In here, have you been a slow burn,
or have you jumped into it?"
"1067","cue","00:50:42,480","00:50:44,920","-I've been more of a slow burn.
-Do you think that's how you are"
"1068","cue","00:50:45,000","00:50:46,600","or because
the right person hasn't come in?"
"1069","cue","00:50:46,680","00:50:50,040","-The right person hasn't come in yet.
-'Cause they've come in an hour ago?"
"1070","cue","00:50:50,120","00:50:51,600","-Maybe. [laughs]
-[laughs]"
"1071","cue","00:50:51,680","00:50:53,200","Mitch is not here for games."
"1072","cue","00:50:53,280","00:50:57,240","He's pulling girls for chats left, right
and center. It's been, like, ten minutes."
"1073","cue","00:50:57,320","00:50:59,680","What's your usual type that you go for?"
"1074","cue","00:50:59,760","00:51:01,680","Everyone in here is, like, attractive."
"1075","cue","00:51:01,760","00:51:05,520","Like, you're a very attractive person.
Like, I'm naturally attracted to you."
"1076","cue","00:51:05,600","00:51:08,040","Of course. Well,
that's what I wanted to hear, but yeah."
"1077","cue","00:51:08,120","00:51:09,400","You're a good-looking girl too."
"1078","cue","00:51:09,480","00:51:11,040","[Tak] He knows what he wants."
"1079","cue","00:51:11,120","00:51:13,680","And now I think he's just
on the hunt to get it."
"1080","cue","00:51:13,760","00:51:16,680","-I always go for, like, the bad boys.
-Do ya?"
"1081","cue","00:51:16,760","00:51:19,360","Yeah. Like, fully, like, tatted up."
"1082","cue","00:51:19,440","00:51:21,920","-Criminal records, literally.
-Fuckin' hell."
"1083","cue","00:51:22,000","00:51:24,960","-I know. I think I like the--
-Maybe you just like being handcuffed."
"1084","cue","00:51:25,040","00:51:27,240","[both laughing]"
"1085","cue","00:51:27,880","00:51:29,280","I'm getting hot."
"1086","cue","00:51:29,360","00:51:31,000","[Jordan] Hundred percent
there's jealousy there."
"1087","cue","00:51:31,080","00:51:32,880","I think all the boys should be worried
about Mitch."
"1088","cue","00:51:32,960","00:51:35,280","-Do you not think I'm confident?
-Nah, you are confident."
"1089","cue","00:51:35,360","00:51:38,000","It's confident.
It doesn't come off as cockiness though."
"1090","cue","00:51:38,080","00:51:39,520","You're going to fall in love with me.
Who knows?"
"1091","cue","00:51:39,600","00:51:41,160","[chuckles]"
"1092","cue","00:51:41,240","00:51:43,480","-I don't-- [chuckles]
-I'm fucking around. [chuckles]"
"1093","cue","00:51:43,560","00:51:45,080","Necks are snapping right now."
"1094","cue","00:51:45,160","00:51:47,960","Five out of the six girls pretty much said
they want to get to know me."
"1095","cue","00:51:48,040","00:51:50,720","So I don't really care
what's gone on the last few weeks,"
"1096","cue","00:51:50,800","00:51:52,760","but, you know, <i>Love Island</i> starts today."
"1097","cue","00:51:54,240","00:51:55,680","[laughs]"
"1098","cue","00:51:58,120","00:52:01,240","[narrator] <i>Think you're a Tina-tiny</i>
<i>bit wrong, Mitchy baby.</i>"
"1099","cue","00:52:01,320","00:52:07,040","<i>'Cause for you and your ex Tina,</i>
Love Island <i>starts tomorrow.</i>"
"1100","cue","00:52:09,920","00:52:10,920","[Tina] I'm Tina."
"1101","cue","00:52:11,000","00:52:15,200","You might remember me as the winner
of last season's <i>Love Island Australia.</i>"
"1102","cue","00:52:17,080","00:52:19,040","I'm looking for the real deal."
"1103","cue","00:52:19,120","00:52:23,120","Last time, I thought I had found something
that was gonna last a long time"
"1104","cue","00:52:23,200","00:52:24,520","and it ended very short."
"1105","cue","00:52:25,400","00:52:29,160","After my breakup,
I haven't been on any dates,"
"1106","cue","00:52:29,240","00:52:32,280","{\an8}so I thought,
what better place to jump back in?"
