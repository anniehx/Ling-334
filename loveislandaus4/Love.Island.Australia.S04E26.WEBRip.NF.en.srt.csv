-I feel like if we were parents,"
"520","cue","00:25:45,320","00:25:48,120","I would be the cool dad
and you would be the strict mum."
"521","cue","00:25:48,200","00:25:49,120","I don't like that."
"522","cue","00:25:49,200","00:25:52,160","Because then it makes it look
like I have to put all the boundaries in."
"523","cue","00:25:52,240","00:25:55,280","But I think it has to be--
I think we get to do turns."

-No, you're not."
"525","cue","00:25:58,320","00:26:00,920","-So, do you ever want kids, or…
-[snorts]"
"526","cue","00:26:01,840","00:26:04,480","Yeah, I actually do. Do you? I want three."
"527","cue","00:26:04,560","00:26:06,120","-Three?
-I want three,"
"528","cue","00:26:06,200","00:26:08,400","because I feel like two is not enough…"
"529","cue","00:26:08,480","00:26:10,520","-Yeah.
-…but four is too many. So I want three."
"530","cue","00:26:10,600","00:26:12,880","-I always wanted about four kids.
-Do you want four kids?"

-Yeah. I grew up in a big family,"
"532","cue","00:26:15,200","00:26:17,400","-so that's why I wanted a big family.
-Yeah."
"533","cue","00:26:17,480","00:26:20,840","And if I have kids I want them
to have the same experience I did…"

more brothers and sisters."

in terms of kids and wanting a family,"

which is a tick."

and then I got to my age now"

-Yeah."
"546","cue","00:26:51,400","00:26:53,480","But, no, 30's good.
I think 30 is a good age."
"547","cue","00:26:53,560","00:26:56,800","I mean five years is a long time
to do all the things that I want to do"

"549","cue","00:26:58,040","00:26:59,960","Think you have a lot of maturing to do."
"550","cue","00:27:00,040","00:27:01,960","[scoffs] Excuse me?"
"551","cue","00:27:02,480","00:27:04,120","No, I can agree on that."

I definitely see kids in the future."

should be dumped tonight."

with a unanimous decision."""

-My heart's beating so fast."
"872","cue","00:44:32,160","00:44:33,040","Okay."
"873","cue","00:44:33,120","00:44:34,720","[Phoebe]
We'll start with Austen and Claudia."
"874","cue","00:44:34,800","00:44:35,600","Yeah."
"875","cue","00:44:35,680","00:44:37,520","[Phoebe] Well, they're already in love."
"876","cue","00:44:37,600","00:44:40,640","I can't really think of any cons
when it comes to Claudia and Austen."
"877","cue","00:44:40,720","00:44:43,720","I feel like they've had
their ups and downs in the villa,"
"878","cue","00:44:43,800","00:44:46,000","but then that kind of is a positive."
"879","cue","00:44:46,080","00:44:47,000","-Yeah.
-[Al] Yeah."
"880","cue","00:44:47,080","00:44:49,920","We think they're
the strongest couple here. We rule it out."
"881","cue","00:44:50,000","00:44:51,440","-That's off the table.
-Yeah."
"882","cue","00:44:51,520","00:44:53,520","-So it's really just two couples.
-So we got two couples."
"883","cue","00:44:53,600","00:44:56,040","And there's Stella and Hugh."
"884","cue","00:44:56,120","00:44:59,560","I feel like it's so fresh that it's
hard to know--"
"885","cue","00:44:59,640","00:45:02,520","I don't know how deep that is.
And I don't know."
"886","cue","00:45:02,600","00:45:06,760","On the other hand, I have spoken to Hugh,
and he's really vibing her."
"887","cue","00:45:06,840","00:45:10,360","She has seemed happier
to have her person in here."
"888","cue","00:45:10,440","00:45:11,280","[Phoebe] Yeah. Exactly."
"889","cue","00:45:11,360","00:45:14,880","-Who's next? There's Callum and Mads.
-Callum and Maddy."
"890","cue","00:45:14,960","00:45:17,600","[Phoebe]
They seem to be vibing a lot so far."
"891","cue","00:45:18,520","00:45:20,160","They're kissing. There's attraction."
"892","cue","00:45:20,240","00:45:23,080","I feel like the only con is--
I think they're both the kind of people"
"893","cue","00:45:23,160","00:45:24,920","-that could get along with anyone.
-[Phoebe] Yeah."
"894","cue","00:45:25,000","00:45:30,880","That's the thing. If they came in at
day one, would they still be together now?"
"895","cue","00:45:30,960","00:45:34,680","It just sucks because I feel like Callum
and Stella have had the same journey."
"896","cue","00:45:34,760","00:45:37,360","They bounced around
so many different couples here,"
"897","cue","00:45:37,960","00:45:40,320","and now one of them
is gonna get cut short,"
"898","cue","00:45:40,400","00:45:42,040","and they're both happy in a couple."
"899","cue","00:45:42,120","00:45:44,760","But I guess it comes down to who do
you think has a stronger connection"
"900","cue","00:45:44,840","00:45:45,880","between both couples?"
"901","cue","00:45:45,960","00:45:48,760","-They had the same amount of time in here.
-My God, I have no idea."
"902","cue","00:45:48,840","00:45:51,240","This is one of the hardest
decisions I've had to make. Let's go."
"903","cue","00:45:52,440","00:45:55,000","-[Al grunts]
-Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me."
"904","cue","00:46:31,920","00:46:34,880","This has been a really difficult decision."
"905","cue","00:46:34,960","00:46:37,000","I know we're all like a family in here,"
"906","cue","00:46:37,080","00:46:40,240","and I feel like everyone in here
at the moment deserves to find love."
"907","cue","00:46:43,880","00:46:48,760","We spoke about all the pros and cons
of every couple in here."
"908","cue","00:46:48,840","00:46:53,160","Obviously there were so many more pros,
like everyone in here deserves love,"
"909","cue","00:46:53,240","00:46:58,240","and you're all such amazing people
and deserve happiness and everything."
"910","cue","00:46:58,320","00:47:00,640","So, yeah, it was a really hard decision."
"911","cue","00:47:05,640","00:47:10,080","The couple we unfortunately
will be sending home tonight is…"
"912","cue","00:47:21,960","00:47:23,200","Stella and Hugh."
"913","cue","00:47:42,080","00:47:43,080","[phone chimes]"
"914","cue","00:47:48,280","00:47:51,000","""Stella and Hugh, you have been dumped."
"915","cue","00:47:51,080","00:47:53,840","You have 30 minutes to pack
and say your goodbyes."""
"916","cue","00:47:58,320","00:47:59,320","Bye."
"917","cue","00:47:59,400","00:48:01,200","-[laughing]
-Bye."
"918","cue","00:48:01,280","00:48:02,520","I'm gonna miss you."
"919","cue","00:48:03,240","00:48:04,760","On the Richter scale,"
"920","cue","00:48:04,840","00:48:09,000","Stella is definitely up there with
one of the nicest humans I've ever met."
"921","cue","00:48:09,080","00:48:12,400","No doubt about it. And that's why
I didn't lay it on her too thick,"
"922","cue","00:48:12,480","00:48:15,760","because I didn't want to break her heart
because she is actually that genuine."
"923","cue","00:48:15,840","00:48:17,920","-Aw. [sighs]
-[sighs]"
"924","cue","00:48:19,160","00:48:21,800","-I love you so much.
-I love you."
"925","cue","00:48:21,880","00:48:23,800","Aw. You make me cry. [laughs]"
"926","cue","00:48:24,680","00:48:26,440","-[Hugh] It's been sweet, bro.
-Yeah, bro."
"927","cue","00:48:26,520","00:48:28,720","Short and sweet,
but we'll have a catch-up soon."
"928","cue","00:48:28,800","00:48:30,680","-A hundred percent, bro.
-I'll see you soon. [laughs]"
"929","cue","00:48:30,760","00:48:31,880","Yeah, I'll see you soon."
"930","cue","00:48:34,640","00:48:37,800","Obviously, you and Mads
have gotten on real well,"
"931","cue","00:48:37,880","00:48:40,720","now that I'm leaving. You're with her.
Don't fuck her over."
"932","cue","00:48:40,800","00:48:43,440","-Nah. Yeah, I won't.
-Don't be an asshole."
"933","cue","00:48:43,520","00:48:46,400","Now that I'm gone, you gotta
step up and take care of her in here."
"934","cue","00:48:46,480","00:48:47,960","Yeah, 100%."
"935","cue","00:48:48,720","00:48:51,880","I'm feeling content, you know?"
"936","cue","00:48:51,960","00:48:57,000","Yeah. You should feel more than content,
you should feel fucking fantastic."
"937","cue","00:48:57,080","00:49:00,280","Stells, I can't even explain how amazing…"
"938","cue","00:49:00,360","00:49:02,720","-[laughs]
-…you were this whole time,"
"939","cue","00:49:02,800","00:49:07,640","and what you went through and how
you just came through all of that"
"940","cue","00:49:07,720","00:49:09,840","is honestly admirable."
"941","cue","00:49:09,920","00:49:12,440","Even though I'm crying, I am feeling good."
"942","cue","00:49:12,520","00:49:14,560","I'm proud and I'm content."
"943","cue","00:49:14,640","00:49:18,400","And I am okay
that my journey has come to an end."

"946","cue","00:49:24,960","00:49:27,800","I'm also happy with what I've done."
"947","cue","00:49:28,480","00:49:31,400","-I love you.
-I love you guys so much."
"948","cue","00:49:31,480","00:49:32,800","So much."
"949","cue","00:49:32,880","00:49:35,920","All of you. You're all so fucking amazing."
"950","cue","00:49:36,000","00:49:39,120","I'm so proud of every single thing I did,"
"951","cue","00:49:39,200","00:49:42,080","and I'm so proud
that I stuck with my guns."
"952","cue","00:49:42,160","00:49:44,800","And I'm so proud
that I did everything I did."
"953","cue","00:49:46,240","00:49:47,440","Like-- [sniffs]"
"954","cue","00:49:47,520","00:49:48,880","Like, go, me. [laughs]"

You're just the most amazing person ever."
"958","cue","00:49:58,760","00:50:01,120","-We came in together.
-[Stella] I know."
"959","cue","00:50:01,200","00:50:04,200","I think that's what just
connects me to you so much."
"960","cue","00:50:04,280","00:50:06,920","-Sleeping in the same room, being 24/7.
-[both crying]"
"961","cue","00:50:07,000","00:50:09,680","-I'm so connected to you. It's insane.
-I know."
"962","cue","00:50:09,760","00:50:11,640","I'm just so sad, Stella."
"963","cue","00:50:11,720","00:50:13,560","-I know.
-[both crying, laughing]"

the same at all without Stella."
"966","cue","00:50:19,080","00:50:22,880","She was honestly our positive vibes."
"967","cue","00:50:24,080","00:50:26,600","She's just such a good person."
"968","cue","00:50:26,680","00:50:29,840","She's such a good person.
She's such a sweet soul."
"969","cue","00:50:29,920","00:50:33,840","And I'm telling you
that girl deserves everything and more."
"970","cue","00:50:33,920","00:50:36,560","-Are we in?
-[Hugh] I can't even see my head."

-Pick her up. Ready?"
