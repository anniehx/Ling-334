at least a day or two to reset."

"147","cue","00:08:03,720","00:08:06,880","but yeah, Jordan's my good mate,
so I didn't want to step on his toes."
"148","cue","00:08:06,960","00:08:10,360","Now this is my opportunity.
One door closes, another door opens."
"149","cue","00:08:10,440","00:08:13,360","I was sort of happy

-Mm-hmm."
"152","cue","00:08:19,680","00:08:21,120","'Cause I don't think I've had that chance."

"502","cue","00:26:53,520","00:26:56,080","You and me, it was just that night for me."
"503","cue","00:26:56,160","00:26:57,560","One night."
"504","cue","00:26:57,640","00:27:02,200","Jordan didn't fully grasp
how much it may have hurt me."
"505","cue","00:27:02,280","00:27:06,280","And I think, to him,
he's going so well with Phoebe"
"506","cue","00:27:06,360","00:27:09,560","that he's kind of forgotten
that like I had feelings there."
"507","cue","00:27:09,640","00:27:13,680","And it's hurtful going through
what I'm going through."

that I'm coming from a place of hurt."
"509","cue","00:27:17,240","00:27:21,600","-All right.
-And I'm trying so hard to be your friend"
"510","cue","00:27:21,680","00:27:23,440","and be okay in this environment,"
"511","cue","00:27:23,520","00:27:26,200","when someone who I've been
coupled up with, who I actually liked…"
"512","cue","00:27:26,280","00:27:28,080","-Yeah.
-…is now with another girl."
"513","cue","00:27:28,160","00:27:31,680","-Like that's a lot for me to process.
-A lot. I've been there."
"514","cue","00:27:31,760","00:27:32,960","-Yeah, exactly.
-I've been there."
"515","cue","00:27:33,040","00:27:35,000","-So you understand, right?
-100%."
"516","cue","00:27:35,080","00:27:39,440","I feel bad. But at the same time,
if I sit here and feel bad for everyone,"
"517","cue","00:27:39,520","00:27:42,120","I'm gonna be, yeah,
chewed up and spat out."
"518","cue","00:27:42,200","00:27:46,080","But yeah, just excuse me
if, over the next few days,"
"519","cue","00:27:46,160","00:27:49,080","I just steer clear you and Phoebe."
"520","cue","00:27:49,160","00:27:52,600","Yeah. I did the exact same
with Austen and Claudia."
"521","cue","00:27:52,680","00:27:54,680","[Stella] I feel like
it was a productive chat."
"522","cue","00:27:54,760","00:27:58,920","And I think with this sort of closure,
I can actually try and move on"
"523","cue","00:27:59,000","00:28:00,920","and try and make connections
with other people."
"524","cue","00:28:01,000","00:28:02,800","-All right, thanks.
-Give me a hug."
"525","cue","00:28:04,200","00:28:05,840","-You'll be all right.
-Thanks."

a couple of dates?"

more a short-term relationship."

a little bit, and it was kind of my side,"

-[Ben] I'm being completely honest."

a different type of dynamic."
"552","cue","00:29:23,440","00:29:26,120","-So it'll be really good.

-[Claudia] Cute."
"642","cue","00:33:14,640","00:33:18,400","He's the kind of person that I think
would just adore a woman."

that I think is suitable for me."

That's how it is."
"830","cue","00:43:40,720","00:43:42,240","I don't wanna have to deal with that."
"831","cue","00:43:42,320","00:43:44,160","We can't think about what we do
in the outside world"
"832","cue","00:43:44,240","00:43:46,160","'cause this is nowhere near
the outside world."
"833","cue","00:43:46,240","00:43:48,240","I know. But I'm thinking
about the outside world."
"834","cue","00:43:48,320","00:43:51,440","The outside world is so far away
from us right now."
"835","cue","00:43:51,960","00:43:53,800","-Like, we have to just think about…
-[sighs]"
"836","cue","00:43:53,880","00:43:56,440","…what is going on in this moment."
"837","cue","00:43:56,520","00:43:58,680","I know, but I feel like
he's just not showing me enough"
"838","cue","00:43:58,760","00:44:00,280","that he actually cares about me."
"839","cue","00:44:01,440","00:44:03,240","[Austen] If there's no light
at the end of the tunnel,"
"840","cue","00:44:03,320","00:44:06,040","with me doing all of this work
and reassurance, then like--"
"841","cue","00:44:06,120","00:44:08,440","-[Callum] ""Why am I bothering?""
-Exactly. What's the point?"
"842","cue","00:44:08,520","00:44:09,680","What's the point of this?"
"843","cue","00:44:09,760","00:44:11,880","How did it end? What was the last words?"
"844","cue","00:44:11,960","00:44:13,400","Are you on good terms?"
"845","cue","00:44:13,480","00:44:15,600","She was like, ""Now you gotta think
about what you want."""
"846","cue","00:44:15,680","00:44:18,440","-And I don't know if I want that now.
-Fuck."
"847","cue","00:44:21,280","00:44:24,680","No matter how much you try to prove
that you are not the same as other guys,"
"848","cue","00:44:24,760","00:44:26,200","it's just not enough."
"849","cue","00:44:26,960","00:44:28,360","Fuck, I'm not gonna cry."
"850","cue","00:44:28,440","00:44:29,560","[cries]"
"851","cue","00:44:42,120","00:44:46,400","I've had so many things done to me…
[sniffs] …that I'm, like--"
"852","cue","00:44:46,480","00:44:49,080","It really messes with your head."
"853","cue","00:44:49,160","00:44:52,360","So, you don't believe that there are
any good guys out there."
"854","cue","00:44:53,920","00:44:57,000","[sniffs] So, it's hard to believe
that Austen is a good guy."
"855","cue","00:44:58,320","00:45:02,320","I want Claudia, but a part of me
is also like, ""Fuck, man."
"856","cue","00:45:02,400","00:45:04,480","It's just gonna be a loop."""
"857","cue","00:45:04,560","00:45:09,400","I think Austen is the perfect guy
to, like, grow with and change with."
"858","cue","00:45:09,480","00:45:11,960","But I don't think I'm
allowing myself to do that"
"859","cue","00:45:12,040","00:45:14,960","because I'm starting to think
maybe Austen needs someone"
"860","cue","00:45:15,040","00:45:17,880","who's more secure in themselves,
and I don't think I am."
"861","cue","00:45:19,280","00:45:20,280","I don't know."
"862","cue","00:45:25,240","00:45:26,320","[sniffs]"
"863","cue","00:45:27,400","00:45:28,480","I don't know."

-[Jess laughing]"
"865","cue","00:45:49,920","00:45:52,120","[Austen sighs]"
"866","cue","00:46:00,920","00:46:04,480","Like, I don't know.
Maybe she does need someone not like me."
"867","cue","00:46:04,560","00:46:06,960","[sniffs] I don't know."
"868","cue","00:46:09,120","00:46:10,800","It does make you feel shit, but…"
"869","cue","00:46:11,960","00:46:13,560","It does make you feel shit."

"873","cue","00:46:42,640","00:46:45,640","<i>It's a romantic date for Jess and Al…</i>"
"874","cue","00:46:46,240","00:46:50,120","-[exclaims] Oy! There we go.
-[Jess] Oh, my God! That was so scary."
"875","cue","00:46:50,200","00:46:52,840","-[narrator] <i>…until it isn't.</i>
-Al."
"876","cue","00:46:52,920","00:46:54,440","-Mmm.
-I got a text."
"877","cue","00:46:54,520","00:46:56,520","-Oh, my God, I actually feel sick.
-Good or bad?"
"878","cue","00:46:57,440","00:47:00,320","""Al and Jess, today isn't just a date."
"879","cue","00:47:00,400","00:47:02,120","It's a business meeting too."
"880","cue","00:47:03,800","00:47:07,160","Tonight, one Islander
will be dumped from the villa."
"881","cue","00:47:08,440","00:47:13,040","It is you who must decide
who is in the firing line."""
"882","cue","00:47:14,560","00:47:16,640","Oh!"
