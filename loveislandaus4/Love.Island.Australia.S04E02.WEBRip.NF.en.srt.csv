do anything with Jess."

"1006","cue","00:50:56,080","00:50:57,200","Jealous as fuck."
"1007","cue","00:50:57,280","00:50:59,400","I think Conor could be manipulative."
"1008","cue","00:51:00,160","00:51:01,160","You're feisty."
"1009","cue","00:51:02,560","00:51:03,960","And I get it. I understand that."
"1010","cue","00:51:04,040","00:51:06,480","But look where you are.
We're not in real life."
"1011","cue","00:51:06,560","00:51:07,640","This feels real life to me."
"1012","cue","00:51:07,720","00:51:10,040","-This feels real to me.
-Exactly, so that's why it's the truth,"
"1013","cue","00:51:10,120","00:51:12,320","the fact that you like me
and I like you. It is real life."
"1014","cue","00:51:12,400","00:51:14,880","-Well, do you see why I'm going off?
-Yeah, but what I'm saying is--"
"1015","cue","00:51:14,960","00:51:16,840","If I didn't like you,
I wouldn't be going off."
"1016","cue","00:51:16,920","00:51:20,880","I would go pull other people for a chat
who actually wanna get to know me."
"1017","cue","00:51:20,960","00:51:23,160","-And I don't?
-But I haven't done it."
"1018","cue","00:51:23,240","00:51:24,520","Are you serious?"
"1019","cue","00:51:25,160","00:51:27,240","How do I not want to get to know you?"
"1020","cue","00:51:29,120","00:51:31,920","I literally have not done anything wrong.
I'm a saint."
"1021","cue","00:51:34,640","00:51:36,800","You're making me look
like a complete idiot."
"1022","cue","00:51:36,880","00:51:38,760","I'm not making you
look like an idiot at all."
"1023","cue","00:51:38,840","00:51:40,200","I feel like an idiot."
"1024","cue","00:51:40,280","00:51:41,920","The more time I spend with you,"
"1025","cue","00:51:42,000","00:51:46,360","I know that I'm gonna sort of
start to develop feelings."
"1026","cue","00:51:46,440","00:51:47,920","Do you have feelings?"
"1027","cue","00:51:49,880","00:51:51,800","I feel like I'm getting there."
"1028","cue","00:51:51,880","00:51:52,960","So do I."
"1029","cue","00:51:53,040","00:51:54,080","And, like--"
"1030","cue","00:51:55,280","00:51:57,560","So do I. And I, like, mean that."
"1031","cue","00:51:58,240","00:51:59,240","Come here."
"1032","cue","00:52:03,760","00:52:06,560","-Can we just move forward?
-Yeah, I-- Okay."
"1033","cue","00:52:06,640","00:52:08,400","I just, you know…"
"1034","cue","00:52:08,480","00:52:11,440","Conor always tries to get out
of an argument by kissing me."
"1035","cue","00:52:12,840","00:52:14,320","And it works. [chuckles]"
"1036","cue","00:52:16,240","00:52:19,200","I know I don't wanna wrap it up
'cause I fucking get jealous."
"1037","cue","00:52:19,280","00:52:21,880","Sorry, it's a red flag, but I get jealous."
"1038","cue","00:52:21,960","00:52:24,440","And I don't wanna think about you
doing it with someone else."
"1039","cue","00:52:24,520","00:52:25,800","All right."
"1040","cue","00:52:25,880","00:52:27,880","'Cause my eyes haven't gone anywhere else."
"1041","cue","00:52:27,960","00:52:28,960","Have they?"
"1042","cue","00:52:29,800","00:52:30,960","Have they?"
"1043","cue","00:52:32,000","00:52:34,600","So I can't be in trouble
'cause it's all just--"
"1044","cue","00:52:34,680","00:52:37,440","It's all talk.
It is nothing that I have done."
"1045","cue","00:52:37,520","00:52:39,480","It's not fair to blame it all on me."
"1046","cue","00:52:39,560","00:52:43,200","And plus it's because of things
that I haven't done. All right?"
"1047","cue","00:52:46,520","00:52:49,280","Yeah, me and Jess are good now,
so we'll see how long it lasts,"
"1048","cue","00:52:49,360","00:52:51,120","but, yeah, we're good right now."
"1049","cue","00:52:53,480","00:52:54,920","[narrator] <i>Next time…</i>"
"1050","cue","00:52:56,200","00:52:57,480","[Layla] I really like Austen."
"1051","cue","00:52:58,080","00:53:00,320","Things are aligning
and he's ticking all my boxes."
"1052","cue","00:53:00,960","00:53:01,960","The kiss today."
"1053","cue","00:53:03,000","00:53:05,400","-Did you feel anything there?
-Yeah."
"1054","cue","00:53:05,480","00:53:07,960","-Did you?
-Wait, did you?"
"1055","cue","00:53:08,640","00:53:09,480","I did."
"1056","cue","00:53:09,560","00:53:11,960","-Have you said that to Layla?
-No, I haven't."
"1057","cue","00:53:14,240","00:53:15,960","[Layla] I'm pissed off and I'm confused"
"1058","cue","00:53:16,040","00:53:18,520","because pretty much all my eggs
were in his basket."
"1059","cue","00:53:20,280","00:53:23,360","I want Austen to tell her it's done."
