"206","cue","00:10:18,720","00:10:22,160","I feel like I got closure with Claudia.
That was something I was looking for."

I just did it in a really random way."
"680","cue","00:32:27,040","00:32:29,640","I don't know.
I just feel like I wanna kiss you again."

Spit it slowly."
"849","cue","00:40:13,920","00:40:15,600","-Slowly.
-[Mitchell] We don't want it to break."
"850","cue","00:40:15,680","00:40:17,720","-[spits]
-[Mitchell groans]"
"851","cue","00:40:17,800","00:40:19,360","I think that's a fail."
"852","cue","00:40:19,440","00:40:21,000","[Phoebe] I can see your balls."
"853","cue","00:40:26,480","00:40:29,720","[narrator] <i>Mitch's striptease</i>

"854","cue","00:40:29,800","00:40:32,040","<i>and that was bad. Drugs are bad too.</i>"
"855","cue","00:40:32,120","00:40:35,560","<i>Mitch is bad. Drugs are bad.</i>

"857","cue","00:40:36,880","00:40:42,280","I think that you are just,
kind of, like a dangerous drug,"
"858","cue","00:40:42,360","00:40:44,200","and you're--"
"859","cue","00:40:44,280","00:40:46,960","-This is how I'm just honestly feeling.
-[chuckles] Okay."
"860","cue","00:40:47,040","00:40:52,640","I feel like
you are like a good sexual temptation."
"861","cue","00:40:52,720","00:40:55,120","I think, deep down,
you're open to get to know me."
"862","cue","00:40:55,200","00:40:58,240","I think you'd like me
when I come and chase you."
"863","cue","00:40:58,320","00:41:01,760","I mean, I see you fucking looking at me,
everything. I notice it."
"864","cue","00:41:01,840","00:41:04,120","Okay, every time I'm not around you…"
"865","cue","00:41:04,200","00:41:05,480","-Yeah.
-…I'm like--"
"866","cue","00:41:05,560","00:41:08,480","Yeah, I know me and Mitchell
have a strong connection."
"867","cue","00:41:08,560","00:41:10,840","I know this is what I want. It's amazing."
"868","cue","00:41:10,920","00:41:13,840","Then every time you pull me for a chat,
I just get scrambled again."
"869","cue","00:41:13,920","00:41:15,920","-So you should stay away from me…
-[laughs]"
"870","cue","00:41:16,000","00:41:18,560","-…so I can live happily ever after.
-Is that what you want? But?"
"871","cue","00:41:19,080","00:41:21,640","I don't know. I'm getting really confused."
"872","cue","00:41:21,720","00:41:24,120","I think her head's just really scrambled
at the moment."
"873","cue","00:41:24,200","00:41:25,720","She's trying to work out what she wants."
"874","cue","00:41:25,800","00:41:28,600","But that's how she should like her eggs,
not her head."
"875","cue","00:41:28,680","00:41:30,200","Let me put this situation then."
"876","cue","00:41:30,720","00:41:32,760","-So, you walk in day one…
-Yeah."
"877","cue","00:41:32,840","00:41:35,920","…and we are all lined up there.
Who are you stepping forward for?"
"878","cue","00:41:36,800","00:41:37,720","[sighs]"
"879","cue","00:41:37,800","00:41:40,320","[Mitch] There you go.
You just answered yourself, haven't you?"
"880","cue","00:41:40,400","00:41:41,480","Yeah, I know."
"881","cue","00:41:42,080","00:41:43,760","How are you feeling this morning?"
"882","cue","00:41:43,840","00:41:46,360","What is it? You're up the creek
without a paddle?"
"883","cue","00:41:46,440","00:41:49,120","-Up shit creek. Without a paddle.
-[Mitchell] Yeah."
"884","cue","00:41:49,200","00:41:50,960","Up shit creek,
going backwards without a paddle."
"885","cue","00:41:51,040","00:41:53,520","You're keen to go for a kayak
but you don't have a paddle."
"886","cue","00:41:53,600","00:41:54,480","[Callum] Yeah."
"887","cue","00:41:54,560","00:41:56,720","If Phoebe continues
to have more chats with Mitch,"
"888","cue","00:41:56,800","00:41:59,560","I'm just gonna have to, you know,
say something"
"889","cue","00:41:59,640","00:42:01,440","and just be like, ""What's going on?"""
"890","cue","00:42:01,520","00:42:04,440","'Cause it's kinda like
she's taking the piss a little bit."
"891","cue","00:42:04,520","00:42:07,600","She said that she would close the door
on a date."
"892","cue","00:42:07,680","00:42:10,760","But if he's pulling her
for more chats, she didn't close the door."
"893","cue","00:42:10,840","00:42:12,680","-Yeah.
-Obviously, she's left it open,"
"894","cue","00:42:12,760","00:42:16,320","and she gets off on it
if he's still pulling her for chats."
"895","cue","00:42:16,400","00:42:19,920","Now it kinda seems
like Phoebe's doing exactly"
"896","cue","00:42:20,000","00:42:22,000","what she told me she didn't like me doing."
"897","cue","00:42:22,080","00:42:25,400","I feel like you say one thing,
but deep down it's pretty obvious"
"898","cue","00:42:25,480","00:42:28,720","-what you really mean by--
-You keep saying this."
"899","cue","00:42:28,800","00:42:31,400","-But I think you know what to--
-You're trying to read me."
"900","cue","00:42:31,480","00:42:34,360","I'm fucking good at reading people.
It's the way you look at me."
"901","cue","00:42:34,440","00:42:38,560","[grunts]
I don't know what to think or feel."
"902","cue","00:42:38,640","00:42:39,960","We'll leave it at that then."
"903","cue","00:42:40,800","00:42:43,880","I'm honestly so confused.
I don't know where my head's at,"
"904","cue","00:42:43,960","00:42:47,680","and I honestly just feel like I'm the
meat in a Mitch sandwich."

"907","cue","00:42:52,560","00:42:56,760","I just want to talk to you
about my chat with Mitch."

-My, God. He's like…"
"909","cue","00:42:58,800","00:43:01,440","[groans] He makes me feel so scrambled."
"910","cue","00:43:01,520","00:43:04,000","But every time I remove myself
from the situation,"
"911","cue","00:43:04,080","00:43:06,640","I actually think about it. I'm like, ""No."""
"912","cue","00:43:06,720","00:43:08,040","[Mitchell] Mmm."
"913","cue","00:43:08,120","00:43:11,720","Like, I just know what I want,
and that's not him."
"914","cue","00:43:11,800","00:43:13,560","-And I want you, so, like--
-Yeah."
"915","cue","00:43:13,640","00:43:15,560","I feel like every time
I get in this situation,"
"916","cue","00:43:15,640","00:43:18,120","I know what I'm gonna say,
then it comes out wrong."
"917","cue","00:43:18,200","00:43:20,320","That's confusing me
and probably confusing him."
"918","cue","00:43:20,400","00:43:21,440","Yeah."
"919","cue","00:43:21,520","00:43:24,040","Phoebe's confused,
and obviously I'm gonna be confused."
"920","cue","00:43:24,120","00:43:26,360","So, you can't have your cake
and eat it too."
"921","cue","00:43:26,880","00:43:30,640","Which we all know I've been in trouble for
in the past."

-Yeah."
"926","cue","00:43:39,480","00:43:43,400","Every time I talk to him,
he's like, ""I'm really liking Stella."""

which was nice."

"929","cue","00:43:50,480","00:43:54,160","I think 'cause Tak has been
a good friend to me this whole time,"

"931","cue","00:43:56,600","00:43:59,520","I don't think I have as many feelings
for Tak as he does for me."

"933","cue","00:44:01,120","00:44:04,720","I don't know if I keep putting Tak
repeatedly in the friend zone."

and be flirty and be fun."

even though it was still nice,"

it just maybe didn't feel right."

"939","cue","00:44:20,280","00:44:25,200","I'm gonna give it my most red hot crack
that I physically possibly can."
"940","cue","00:44:25,800","00:44:30,920","I do want to give it a go,
so I just want today with Tak."
"941","cue","00:44:31,000","00:44:34,320","I wanna see how it goes.
Have those chats with him."
"942","cue","00:44:34,400","00:44:36,240","See how I feel
when I'm having those chats."
