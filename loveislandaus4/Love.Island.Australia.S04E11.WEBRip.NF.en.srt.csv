"834","cue","00:36:17,440","00:36:18,480","-[Vakoo] Yeah.
-[Tak] Who? Go."
"835","cue","00:36:18,560","00:36:20,360","-This is really good.
-[Tak] I wanna know."
"836","cue","00:36:20,440","00:36:22,240","We're all interested. Egos will be torn."
"837","cue","00:36:22,320","00:36:23,880","-Okay.
-[Austen] Who do you think's the best?"
"838","cue","00:36:27,000","00:36:28,160","[chuckles]"
"839","cue","00:36:28,240","00:36:30,240","Oh… The best?"
"840","cue","00:36:30,320","00:36:32,080","I would say either you or you."
"841","cue","00:36:33,280","00:36:36,080","-Yeah, that's probably accurate.
-[Vakoo, Austen laugh]"
"842","cue","00:36:37,760","00:36:39,440","-Keep going.
-[Austen] What would you say he's like?"
"843","cue","00:36:39,520","00:36:41,200","If I looked at Callum…"
"844","cue","00:36:41,280","00:36:42,400","-[Austen] At who?
-[Mitchell] What?"
"845","cue","00:36:42,480","00:36:46,320","…Callum seems like he doesn't care
about your needs."
"846","cue","00:36:46,400","00:36:48,720","[all laughing]"
"847","cue","00:36:48,800","00:36:51,920","-Oh, that's spot on! Spot on!
-Bull's-eye!"
"848","cue","00:36:52,000","00:36:55,000","Yeah, once she said that, I was expecting
her to be beating around the bush,"
"849","cue","00:36:55,080","00:36:56,960","trying to be everyone's friend
and be really nice."
"850","cue","00:36:57,040","00:36:59,200","But she just said it straightaway to me."
"851","cue","00:36:59,280","00:37:01,520","And I love that
because it's put me in my place."
"852","cue","00:37:01,600","00:37:02,880","I know she's got confidence,"
"853","cue","00:37:02,960","00:37:05,760","and there's nothing hotter than a bird
that's got confidence."
"854","cue","00:37:05,840","00:37:07,880","That, to me, is a game changer."
"855","cue","00:37:07,960","00:37:11,000","I am guilty of having sex
with mirrors in the room,"
"856","cue","00:37:11,080","00:37:13,440","and I'm not looking at the girl,
I'm looking at myself in the mirror."
"857","cue","00:37:13,520","00:37:14,760","-Shut up!
-[Callum] Because my veins,"
"858","cue","00:37:14,840","00:37:17,000","I have this mega shoulder vein here
that comes through."
"859","cue","00:37:17,080","00:37:19,720","And I just kind of go like that.
I was like, ""Fucking hell."""
"860","cue","00:37:20,520","00:37:24,200","If a guy is really hot,
he's really bad at sex."
"861","cue","00:37:24,280","00:37:26,560","It's math. It's science.
I don't make the rules."
"862","cue","00:37:26,640","00:37:30,360","That's your choice if you wanna go there
after I've told you this amazing advice,"
"863","cue","00:37:30,440","00:37:31,600","but it's science."

-[Jess] Hi!"
"870","cue","00:37:45,040","00:37:46,320","-Yeah.
-Let's say hello."
"871","cue","00:37:46,400","00:37:47,640","[Layla] Yeah, I see her there."

"875","cue","00:37:51,960","00:37:53,360","-Good?
-[Phoebe] Fuck!"

-[Claudia] Hello."
"880","cue","00:37:59,800","00:38:01,680","-Oh, hello.
-[Jess] Sorry."
"881","cue","00:38:01,760","00:38:04,920","-Hi, I'm Stella.
-Vakoo, nice to meet you."
"882","cue","00:38:05,000","00:38:09,000","It was so hard to put on a lying face"
"883","cue","00:38:09,080","00:38:12,600","and pretend like I didn't see
every single word that they said."
"884","cue","00:38:12,680","00:38:14,040","-[Phoebe H] So nerve-racking.
-Hi, I'm Phoebe."
"885","cue","00:38:14,120","00:38:15,080","-Hello.
-[Phoebe H laughing]"
"886","cue","00:38:15,160","00:38:16,920","-Nice to meet you.
-Great name."
"887","cue","00:38:17,000","00:38:18,480","-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Layla."
"888","cue","00:38:18,560","00:38:20,040","-Hi.
-Nice to meet you."
"889","cue","00:38:20,120","00:38:23,400","-[Al] How was the day?
-We had a picnic by the ocean,"
"890","cue","00:38:23,480","00:38:25,240","and there were cheese platters and wine."
"891","cue","00:38:25,320","00:38:26,200","-[Al] Oh, really?
-Yeah."
"892","cue","00:38:26,280","00:38:28,880","We had speed dates
with the two bombshells."
"893","cue","00:38:28,960","00:38:31,600","-You all had speed dates?

"894","cue","00:38:31,680","00:38:35,040","-[Layla] You wanna go for a girls chat?
-Yeah, we're going for a girls chat."
"895","cue","00:38:40,440","00:38:42,560","[Phoebe]
What did you guys do when you got here?"
"896","cue","00:38:42,640","00:38:43,840","We did a speed dating thing."
"897","cue","00:38:43,920","00:38:46,040","We arrived
and the boys were sitting there."
"898","cue","00:38:46,120","00:38:48,760","We'll tell you now, just off the bat,"
"899","cue","00:38:48,840","00:38:53,240","that, who was it,
Austen and Mitch were very like--"
"900","cue","00:38:53,320","00:38:56,880","Especially Austen, he was like,
""I am falling."""
"901","cue","00:38:56,960","00:38:58,200","[Phoebe] We did really well."
"902","cue","00:38:58,280","00:39:01,200","They literally have no idea,
which is the best thing ever."
"903","cue","00:39:01,280","00:39:04,000","We can assure you
his head is not gonna be turned."
"904","cue","00:39:04,080","00:39:08,680","Mitch said the same thing. Mitch was like,
""Mate, I'm really-- I'm falling."""
"905","cue","00:39:08,760","00:39:10,080","[Islanders] Aw."
"906","cue","00:39:10,160","00:39:12,120","And then all the other guys
are fucking dogs."

"908","cue","00:39:13,200","00:39:14,720","-[Phoebe] Dogs.
-I'm kidding, no."
"909","cue","00:39:14,800","00:39:15,640","That's great."
"910","cue","00:39:15,720","00:39:17,240","[Phoebe]
So, who are you getting vibes off of?"
"911","cue","00:39:17,320","00:39:20,960","Tak, Callum and Jordan."
"912","cue","00:39:21,040","00:39:22,960","Jordan really surprised me."
"913","cue","00:39:23,040","00:39:24,240","Everyone likes my man."
"914","cue","00:39:24,320","00:39:26,720","And everyone wants my man."
"915","cue","00:39:26,800","00:39:28,560","You? What about you, Phoebs?"
"916","cue","00:39:28,640","00:39:29,800","Who are you vibing?"
"917","cue","00:39:29,880","00:39:32,920","So my top was Mitch and then Jordan."
"918","cue","00:39:33,000","00:39:36,160","They're both interested in Jordan. [sighs]"
"919","cue","00:39:36,240","00:39:38,040","I feel so threatened. [chuckles]"
"920","cue","00:39:38,120","00:39:40,320","-So you're with Callum?
-Yeah."
"921","cue","00:39:40,400","00:39:43,240","Yeah. No, it is going good."
"922","cue","00:39:43,320","00:39:46,560","He's just opened up and he's really--
The girls even can say"
"923","cue","00:39:46,640","00:39:48,680","he's calmed the fuck down
when he's with me."
"924","cue","00:39:48,760","00:39:50,200","I've changed the man."
"925","cue","00:39:50,280","00:39:55,040","He said, ""I was a big fuckboy before
and then I met her, and I'm just--"""
"926","cue","00:39:55,120","00:39:58,400","Then he's like, ""But the experience
is just what it is. You have to get--"""
"927","cue","00:39:58,480","00:39:59,680","I mean it is <i>Love Island</i>."
"928","cue","00:40:00,560","00:40:03,360","I'm excited to, maybe like,
switch it up a little bit."
"929","cue","00:40:03,440","00:40:05,880","Because everyone's a bit too comfortable
for my liking."
"930","cue","00:40:05,960","00:40:07,840","-You also gotta do what you gotta do.
-[Phoebe H] Yeah."
"931","cue","00:40:07,920","00:40:09,960","But at the end of the day,
it's up to the boys as well."
"932","cue","00:40:10,040","00:40:12,160","-If they--
-They have to reciprocate it."
"933","cue","00:40:12,240","00:40:15,360","[Phoebe H] My brain is so confused
on which boy I like."
"934","cue","00:40:15,440","00:40:18,440","I think I'll know a bit more tonight."
"935","cue","00:40:23,040","00:40:24,280","[Al] Here's Aquaman, bro."
"936","cue","00:40:24,360","00:40:26,000","A Greek goddess, apparently."
"937","cue","00:40:28,040","00:40:29,680","[Callum] A mega shirt.
Best one you've put on so far."
"938","cue","00:40:29,760","00:40:31,720","Do you reckon?
I was saving this for the bombshells."
"939","cue","00:40:31,800","00:40:33,440","Do you know how to use an iron, Claudia?"
"940","cue","00:40:34,040","00:40:36,960","-How do you know how to iron?
-I barely do, hey."

"1004","cue","00:43:40,560","00:43:41,760","-Hmm.
-[Callum chuckles]"
"1005","cue","00:43:41,840","00:43:45,960","-Oh, fuck.
-""Oh, fuck""? Why are you saying that?"
"1006","cue","00:43:46,040","00:43:48,200","[Callum]
I've been in this situation a few times."
"1007","cue","00:43:48,280","00:43:51,280","-[Layla] Yes?
-And I know-- I know what's coming, so…"
"1008","cue","00:43:51,360","00:43:52,200","Yeah. What's coming?"
"1009","cue","00:43:52,280","00:43:54,080","-What do you think is coming?
-I don't know."
"1010","cue","00:43:57,520","00:44:00,320","Callum has definitely been
in this sort of situation before."
"1011","cue","00:44:00,400","00:44:01,400","Bit of trouble."
"1012","cue","00:44:01,480","00:44:02,560","Bit of the doghouse."
"1013","cue","00:44:02,640","00:44:04,320","-Sit down.
-[Callum chuckles]"
"1014","cue","00:44:04,400","00:44:06,480","-Get your ass there.
-[Callum chuckles]"
"1015","cue","00:44:07,000","00:44:10,400","Layla has seen me on those dates.
[blows raspberry]"
"1016","cue","00:44:10,480","00:44:11,760","Disaster."
"1017","cue","00:44:11,840","00:44:13,520","-So I saw everything.
-[Callum chuckles]"
"1018","cue","00:44:14,440","00:44:15,440","Fuck."
"1019","cue","00:44:15,520","00:44:17,360","-[Callum] What exactly did you see?
-[Layla] Vakoo."
"1020","cue","00:44:17,440","00:44:19,400","She was asking about me,
and you were like, ""We're good."""
"1021","cue","00:44:19,480","00:44:21,160","Then she said,
""How long have you been together?"""
"1022","cue","00:44:21,240","00:44:23,080","-[Callum] Yeah.
-You said, ""Three days."""
"1023","cue","00:44:23,160","00:44:26,760","[groans] How long-- I don't know
how long we've been together for."
"1024","cue","00:44:26,840","00:44:29,080","-It's been over a week, yeah.
-Okay."
"1025","cue","00:44:29,920","00:44:31,600","Like… [groans]"
"1026","cue","00:44:31,680","00:44:36,360","And you kept using the excuse of,
""But we're on <i>Love Island.</i>"""
"1027","cue","00:44:36,440","00:44:37,960","Oh, yeah."
"1028","cue","00:44:38,040","00:44:40,880","You're like, ""I'm really happy,
but we are on <i>Love Island.</i>"""
"1029","cue","00:44:40,960","00:44:41,800","Yeah."
"1030","cue","00:44:41,880","00:44:44,640","I thought I squeezed
more fuckboy out of you than I did."
"1031","cue","00:44:44,720","00:44:46,120","[Callum] If there's one skill I've got,"
"1032","cue","00:44:46,200","00:44:49,880","it's getting myself
out of sticky situations with birds."
"1033","cue","00:44:49,960","00:44:52,320","-I know I said some shit.
-Yeah."
"1034","cue","00:44:52,400","00:44:55,280","I'm always in sticky situations.
Every weekend."
"1035","cue","00:44:55,360","00:44:57,240","Not the right type of sticky either.
[chuckles]"
"1036","cue","00:44:57,320","00:44:59,800","I know I said that stuff
but I don't feel like I was in the wrong."
"1037","cue","00:44:59,880","00:45:02,000","I know what it's like to come in
and be on people's toes."
"1038","cue","00:45:02,080","00:45:05,240","I didn't wanna be the one that's like,
""No, I'm a closed book. Don't talk to me."""
"1039","cue","00:45:05,320","00:45:07,680","I think that's rude.
I feel like that's genuinely rude."
"1040","cue","00:45:07,760","00:45:10,840","Callum, when he was on these dates,
he was a bit flirty"
"1041","cue","00:45:10,920","00:45:14,520","and he was a bit, you know,
fuckboy energy vibes."
"1042","cue","00:45:14,600","00:45:17,880","But I can't get angry
'cause I still like him."
"1043","cue","00:45:17,960","00:45:19,160","And I'm like… [moans]"
"1044","cue","00:45:19,240","00:45:21,960","I wasn't mad.
I was a bit like, ""Ugh,"" in the moment."
"1045","cue","00:45:22,040","00:45:24,480","But I was like, ""I understand."""
"1046","cue","00:45:24,560","00:45:27,760","'Cause you do have a flirty personality.
And a bit of competition never hurt."
"1047","cue","00:45:27,840","00:45:28,840","Perfect."
"1048","cue","00:45:29,440","00:45:32,200","Got myself out of that situation.
Quick smart."
"1049","cue","00:45:33,760","00:45:34,880","All right. [grunts]"
"1050","cue","00:45:35,560","00:45:36,560","Start."
"1051","cue","00:45:37,480","00:45:38,480","Um…"
"1052","cue","00:45:38,560","00:45:41,240","Obviously it was not nice
watching you on two dates."
"1053","cue","00:45:41,320","00:45:44,320","But I was squeezing your pillow so tight,
in the bed going--"
"1054","cue","00:45:44,400","00:45:46,680","-Were you guys just in there?
-Yeah, we were in the bedroom."
"1055","cue","00:45:46,760","00:45:47,920","Fuck."
"1056","cue","00:45:48,000","00:45:51,280","It's <i>Love Island</i>,
and I know it's such a cop out,"
"1057","cue","00:45:51,360","00:45:53,240","but I haven't really had the experience."
"1058","cue","00:45:53,320","00:45:54,840","I've been coupled up from day one."
"1059","cue","00:45:54,920","00:45:56,840","And I thought
I wanted to have a bit of fun."
"1060","cue","00:45:56,920","00:45:59,200","-Flirting with girls.
-I didn't choose it."
"1061","cue","00:45:59,280","00:46:00,480","I know you didn't choose it."
"1062","cue","00:46:00,560","00:46:04,200","I can't help how I am with girls
because it's just embedded in me."
"1063","cue","00:46:04,280","00:46:06,480","Oh, well. I think I did well."
"1064","cue","00:46:06,560","00:46:09,360","[Phoebe] When you said,
""Whatever happens, happens,"""
"1065","cue","00:46:09,440","00:46:14,120","I was going, ""This fucking idiot has not
learned anything that I've told him."""
"1066","cue","00:46:14,200","00:46:17,320","The bombshells will shake things up
because that's what bombshells are for."
"1067","cue","00:46:17,400","00:46:19,880","And the last bombshell that came in,
which was Maddy,"
"1068","cue","00:46:19,960","00:46:22,280","shook things up a lot for me and Mitch."
"1069","cue","00:46:22,360","00:46:23,360","She stole my man,"
"1070","cue","00:46:23,440","00:46:26,600","and we had to sleep separately
for a couple of nights."
"1071","cue","00:46:26,680","00:46:30,240","And if that happens again,
I'm going to lose my shit."
"1072","cue","00:46:30,320","00:46:33,360","-You think I'm crazy?
-No, I don't. I just think--"
"1073","cue","00:46:33,440","00:46:35,960","I just think you, um…"
"1074","cue","00:46:36,040","00:46:37,960","How do I word this? [chuckles]"
"1075","cue","00:46:38,040","00:46:43,520","I think you read too much
into the thing that I said."
"1076","cue","00:46:43,600","00:46:45,480","-What happens, happens.
-What happens, happens."
"1077","cue","00:46:45,560","00:46:47,560","It means what happens, happens, you know?"
"1078","cue","00:46:47,640","00:46:49,920","I just don't want her
to take it the wrong way"
"1079","cue","00:46:50,000","00:46:51,440","and for me to go through the same thing."
"1080","cue","00:46:51,520","00:46:54,240","'Cause I honestly would not be able
to handle it and I'd probably just leave."
"1081","cue","00:46:54,320","00:46:56,040","Uh-oh. It's, um…"
"1082","cue","00:46:56,760","00:46:59,800","Yeah, no. No, I'm not open
to getting to know her."
"1083","cue","00:46:59,880","00:47:01,000","[Phoebe] Okay."
"1084","cue","00:47:01,840","00:47:03,760","-Can I believe you?
-Yeah."
"1085","cue","00:47:06,880","00:47:08,640","I had no idea you guys were watching."
"1086","cue","00:47:09,240","00:47:10,400","Yeah."
"1087","cue","00:47:10,480","00:47:14,960","So I guess I wanna know
what you meant when you said"
"1088","cue","00:47:15,040","00:47:18,680","that you felt that so far in our coupling,
it had been a bit one-sided,"
"1089","cue","00:47:18,760","00:47:23,000","and you were putting in heaps of effort,
and I wasn't reciprocating."
"1090","cue","00:47:23,080","00:47:25,000","I don't know.
I feel like I was putting more effort,"
"1091","cue","00:47:25,080","00:47:26,640","like starting conversations
in the mornings,"
"1092","cue","00:47:26,720","00:47:29,760","asking questions, the date."
"1093","cue","00:47:29,840","00:47:32,160","It just felt like
I was putting in more effort"
"1094","cue","00:47:32,880","00:47:34,640","and it wasn't really being reciprocated."
"1095","cue","00:47:35,600","00:47:41,640","Yeah. I agree with you feeling that way
because I felt that myself."
"1096","cue","00:47:41,720","00:47:44,440","Ever since we coupled up,
I knew that we were really good friends"
"1097","cue","00:47:44,520","00:47:49,000","and that we matched in every way,
you ticked every box on paper."
"1098","cue","00:47:49,080","00:47:52,880","But it was just like
that feeling of physical attraction"
"1099","cue","00:47:52,960","00:47:55,440","and spark and passion and fire
that I was missing."
"1100","cue","00:47:55,520","00:47:56,480","[Tak] Mmm."
"1101","cue","00:47:56,560","00:47:59,840","And I just haven't been able to ignite it."
"1102","cue","00:48:00,880","00:48:03,920","And I don't know why
because you're doing everything you can."
"1103","cue","00:48:04,640","00:48:05,840","It's just shit."
"1104","cue","00:48:05,920","00:48:10,160","It's shit that someone that's so perfect
in every other way."
"1105","cue","00:48:10,840","00:48:14,680","I just can't seem to get it
to where I want it to be."
"1106","cue","00:48:14,760","00:48:16,840","So why wouldn't you just say that?"
"1107","cue","00:48:16,920","00:48:19,280","-Because--
-Because I wanted to make it work."
"1108","cue","00:48:19,360","00:48:21,360","No. You told me it was good."
"1109","cue","00:48:24,280","00:48:26,200","Why wouldn't you just voice what you felt?"
"1110","cue","00:48:27,960","00:48:30,240","I told you from the start,"
"1111","cue","00:48:30,320","00:48:32,400","if you're feeling something,
if you're not, tell me."
"1112","cue","00:48:34,000","00:48:36,080","I feel like if Maddy had told me
from the start"
"1113","cue","00:48:36,160","00:48:38,800","that she wasn't attracted to me that way,
I wouldn't have pursued her."
"1114","cue","00:48:38,880","00:48:44,080","At the end of the day, I'm not gonna
put wood on a fire that's not lit."
"1115","cue","00:48:44,160","00:48:45,000","You know?"
"1116","cue","00:48:54,640","00:48:59,400","I want you to find love in here.
I want you to get what you came here for."
"1117","cue","00:48:59,480","00:49:02,440","I want you to make the most
of this experience."
"1118","cue","00:49:02,520","00:49:05,440","But I feel like I would just be
holding you back"
"1119","cue","00:49:07,160","00:49:10,080","if we stayed together
or if you didn't talk to these girls,"
"1120","cue","00:49:10,160","00:49:12,200","and get to know them just because of me."
"1121","cue","00:49:13,440","00:49:14,480","[Tak sighs]"
"1122","cue","00:49:17,120","00:49:18,600","Fuck. [exhales deeply]"
"1123","cue","00:49:20,240","00:49:21,280","Dead."
"1124","cue","00:49:24,240","00:49:26,800","-I think I just need a second.
-Yeah."
"1125","cue","00:49:26,880","00:49:30,000","I'll let you collect your thoughts."
"1126","cue","00:49:32,560","00:49:34,640","[Tak]
I felt a little bit hurt, to be honest."
"1127","cue","00:49:34,720","00:49:36,720","I feel a little bit stupid,"
"1128","cue","00:49:36,800","00:49:41,320","in the sense that I was putting
so much effort into someone"
"1129","cue","00:49:41,400","00:49:46,520","who didn't even
feel the attraction for me."
"1130","cue","00:49:46,600","00:49:49,040","Sometimes you put your foot out and then…"
"1131","cue","00:49:51,320","00:49:53,800","it just blows up in your face
a little bit."
"1132","cue","00:50:04,560","00:50:06,480","-Wanna chat?
-Yeah."
"1133","cue","00:50:06,560","00:50:09,040","Watching the dates, I was furious."
"1134","cue","00:50:09,120","00:50:11,080","I am not letting Al off the hook."
"1135","cue","00:50:11,160","00:50:13,680","[Jess]
So obviously I watched the whole thing."
"1136","cue","00:50:13,760","00:50:15,160","-Okay.
-Okay."
"1137","cue","00:50:15,240","00:50:16,320","Yes, sir."
"1138","cue","00:50:18,280","00:50:19,960","What are you looking at me like that for?"
"1139","cue","00:50:20,040","00:50:25,480","I genuinely thought that, you know,
I did well on the date."
"1140","cue","00:50:26,560","00:50:27,640","No!"
"1141","cue","00:50:28,160","00:50:31,200","It was a test and you failed."
"1142","cue","00:50:31,280","00:50:32,600","You failed."
"1143","cue","00:50:32,680","00:50:35,600","If you genuinely think
that you did well on those dates,"
"1144","cue","00:50:35,680","00:50:37,760","I'm very, very concerned."
"1145","cue","00:50:38,360","00:50:40,640","There were comments that you made which…"
"1146","cue","00:50:41,840","00:50:43,080","annoyed me,"
"1147","cue","00:50:43,160","00:50:45,600","'cause it made me feel
like you were really laying it on them."
"1148","cue","00:50:45,680","00:50:46,520","Yep."
"1149","cue","00:50:46,600","00:50:48,280","[Jess]
The first one was you forgetting my name."
"1150","cue","00:50:48,360","00:50:50,400","Come on, Al.
We've shared a bed for four days."
"1151","cue","00:50:50,480","00:50:54,040","And I know that it's early days for you,
but to forget my name is embarrassing."
"1152","cue","00:50:56,000","00:51:00,160","Second one is with Vakoo or Vaka,
whatever her name is."
"1153","cue","00:51:00,240","00:51:02,040","You know each other in the outside world"
"1154","cue","00:51:02,120","00:51:07,280","and you said that it was like destiny
that you guys were meant to be together."
"1155","cue","00:51:07,360","00:51:08,960","-Something along those lines.
-Yeah."
"1156","cue","00:51:09,040","00:51:11,160","But then you made a joke
about sharing a bed with her."
"1157","cue","00:51:11,240","00:51:12,840","-Mm-hmm.
-That's really cooked."
"1158","cue","00:51:12,920","00:51:15,200","I was hardly even flirting.
I can go way worse."
"1159","cue","00:51:15,280","00:51:18,280","I don't think she should be
that angry at me."
"1160","cue","00:51:18,360","00:51:21,920","Al, let's be real.
You're a very attractive guy."
"1161","cue","00:51:23,240","00:51:24,880","Girls are gonna want you."
"1162","cue","00:51:24,960","00:51:26,040","Brilliant."
"1163","cue","00:51:26,120","00:51:28,920","If you talk to a girl like that,
they're gonna jump on you."
"1164","cue","00:51:29,000","00:51:29,880","Yeah."
"1165","cue","00:51:29,960","00:51:32,720","Do you want to get to know them
on that level?"
"1166","cue","00:51:35,280","00:51:37,680","Um-- [clears throat]
What level are you talking about?"
"1167","cue","00:51:39,560","00:51:41,160","-Like--
-Come on, Al."
"1168","cue","00:51:42,400","00:51:45,000","In terms of coupling up…"
"1169","cue","00:51:47,160","00:51:48,280","my eyes are still for you."

we're gonna make our own version."
