"678","cue","00:34:19,400","00:34:26,120","It's just all fun and
we don't have that deeper connection."
"679","cue","00:34:26,199","00:34:30,600","I guess it's good, I guess, with us
'cause we have a lot of foundation blocks."
"680","cue","00:34:30,679","00:34:34,199","Yeah, and I know
that I could build from that."
"681","cue","00:34:34,280","00:34:36,679","[Stella]
I don't know exactly where his head's at"
"682","cue","00:34:36,760","00:34:39,960","but I think I do have a good connection
with him."

"684","cue","00:34:41,840","00:34:44,000","<i>That is pinky's crack hole.</i>"
"685","cue","00:34:44,080","00:34:46,159","<i>Sorry, I'm distracto.</i>"
"686","cue","00:34:46,239","00:34:48,320","<i>Back to Tak and Vakoo.</i>"
"687","cue","00:34:48,400","00:34:50,920","Everyone's just freaking out
and I'm just like…"
"688","cue","00:34:51,000","00:34:54,239","-Whatever happens happens.
-Yeah, because this is my last night."
"689","cue","00:34:54,320","00:34:57,440","-I don't want to spend my last few hours.
-It's stressing. You wanna have fun."
"690","cue","00:34:57,520","00:34:59,520","-I wanna look fucking sexy tonight.
-Yeah."
"691","cue","00:34:59,600","00:35:01,480","-I'm gonna wear a hot pink dress.
-Hot pink?"
"692","cue","00:35:01,560","00:35:04,640","A mini one. My back is gonna be out
'cause I have a sexy back."
"693","cue","00:35:04,720","00:35:05,800","Mm-hmm."
"694","cue","00:35:05,880","00:35:09,840","And obviously my best friends."
"695","cue","00:35:09,920","00:35:11,560","-Your best friends?
-Yeah."
"696","cue","00:35:11,640","00:35:13,880","And my legs. It's a short dress."
"697","cue","00:35:13,960","00:35:16,720","I think Vak's stunning.
I think there's sexual attraction there."
"698","cue","00:35:16,800","00:35:18,720","Obviously I haven't really acted
too much on it."
"699","cue","00:35:18,800","00:35:20,640","That's just 'cause
she was coupled up with Callum."
"700","cue","00:35:20,720","00:35:23,280","I mean, since I got here,
it was either you or Callum."
"701","cue","00:35:23,360","00:35:25,080","That was the only two connections."
"702","cue","00:35:25,160","00:35:30,240","But having said that, I know you also have
a strong connection with Stella."
"703","cue","00:35:31,120","00:35:34,880","See, now this is where I gotta weigh up.
Do my weighing up."
"704","cue","00:35:34,960","00:35:38,400","I'm thinking about that also
I've had time with Stella…"
"705","cue","00:35:38,480","00:35:40,600","-Yeah.
-…but then I haven't had time with you."
"706","cue","00:35:40,680","00:35:43,400","But you've had time with Stella
and it hasn't really gone anywhere."
"707","cue","00:35:43,480","00:35:44,760","It hasn't really."
"708","cue","00:35:45,400","00:35:48,360","-You had a crush on me since I walked in.
-Yeah."
"709","cue","00:35:48,440","00:35:50,720","I'm really hoping
that Tak chooses me tonight"
"710","cue","00:35:50,800","00:35:53,120","because I think something could blossom
between Tak and I"
"711","cue","00:35:53,200","00:35:54,800","if I put in the effort."
"712","cue","00:35:54,880","00:35:57,320","I bet your voice after midnight
is so sexy."
"713","cue","00:35:57,400","00:35:59,440","-It is. Yeah.
-And in the morning?"
"714","cue","00:35:59,520","00:36:02,400","It gets really deep and husky."
"715","cue","00:36:04,000","00:36:05,400","[both chuckle]"
"716","cue","00:36:05,480","00:36:07,760","Just having a chat with Vak, um,"
"717","cue","00:36:07,840","00:36:12,000","and realizing that that sexual chemistry
and sexual energy was there"
"718","cue","00:36:12,080","00:36:18,160","sort of made me, you know, think about
the whole situation in different light."
"719","cue","00:36:18,760","00:36:22,240","And maybe that is something
worth exploring."
"720","cue","00:36:22,320","00:36:24,640","-Our names are gonna be so cute.
-Vak and Tak."
"721","cue","00:36:24,720","00:36:25,720","Vak and Tak."
"722","cue","00:36:25,800","00:36:26,840","[both chuckle]"
"723","cue","00:36:26,920","00:36:28,440","Didn't know you close your eyes
when you laugh."
"724","cue","00:36:28,520","00:36:30,720","Obviously.
Who laughs with their eyes open?"
"725","cue","00:36:31,280","00:36:33,120","[both chuckle]"
"726","cue","00:36:33,200","00:36:34,800","Do you not laugh with your eyes closed?"
"727","cue","00:36:34,880","00:36:36,560","-Not completely.
-That's weird."
"728","cue","00:36:36,640","00:36:38,520","You probably kiss with your eyes open."
"729","cue","00:36:38,600","00:36:40,720","No, that's weird.
That's serial killer vibes."
"730","cue","00:36:40,800","00:36:41,840","Yeah. That's not okay."
"731","cue","00:36:41,920","00:36:43,800","If somebody kisses you
and their eyes are still open,"
"732","cue","00:36:43,880","00:36:44,720","I'd be scared."
"733","cue","00:36:44,800","00:36:45,800","[laughs]"
"734","cue","00:36:45,880","00:36:47,880","[Tak] I thought I was pretty set.
Now I'm not so sure."
"735","cue","00:36:47,960","00:36:51,320","At this point in time, I don't think
I really know who I wanna pick."
"736","cue","00:36:51,400","00:36:52,720","I think it will be a tough decision."
"737","cue","00:36:52,800","00:36:55,280","And I know one of them
will have to go home."
"738","cue","00:36:55,360","00:36:56,520","Doesn't make it easy."
"739","cue","00:37:08,200","00:37:10,240","-I had a really good chat with Vak.
-Yeah."
"740","cue","00:37:10,320","00:37:11,560","Proper vibing."
"741","cue","00:37:11,640","00:37:14,440","I was like, ""What the fuck?""
Why do this now?"
"742","cue","00:37:14,520","00:37:17,280","We've obviously had some good chats
with Stella too."
"743","cue","00:37:20,360","00:37:22,720","The more I talk to Tak,
the more I feel something."
"744","cue","00:37:22,800","00:37:24,800","You don't know
what the boys are thinking at all."
"745","cue","00:37:24,880","00:37:27,600","-They're very--
-No. I literally have no idea who."
"746","cue","00:37:27,680","00:37:29,080","I'm not ready to go home."
"747","cue","00:37:29,160","00:37:33,400","And the thought is just--
It's making me really nervous."
"748","cue","00:37:33,480","00:37:35,160","It's just making me feel sick."
"749","cue","00:37:35,240","00:37:38,440","To me, it's really so close.
I mean, I can't pull them apart."
"750","cue","00:37:39,160","00:37:41,880","My head's scrambled like a drawer
full of phone chargers."
"751","cue","00:37:41,960","00:37:44,520","I'm kind of weighing
the pros and cons of both."
"752","cue","00:37:44,600","00:37:45,640","It's really stressful."
"753","cue","00:37:46,240","00:37:48,440","I'm super worried.
I'm actually scared shitless."
"754","cue","00:37:49,480","00:37:55,760","One of us will be going home tonight
and it just makes me really sad."

will you be around to see them?"

the connection grows stronger."

we have something special,"

"828","cue","00:42:53,920","00:42:54,920","He's so cute."
"829","cue","00:42:55,000","00:42:56,600","Yeah, it was like <i>The Notebook</i>
a little bit."
"830","cue","00:42:56,680","00:42:59,720","-I know.
-Stop. That's my favorite movie."
"831","cue","00:43:02,200","00:43:04,440","Mitchell, please stand up."

"834","cue","00:43:13,120","00:43:16,800","because, uh, this week
I've been a bit of a twat. Um…"
"835","cue","00:43:16,880","00:43:18,800","-[Sophie] Oh.
-I've played up a little bit,"
"836","cue","00:43:18,880","00:43:22,440","but she has showed
she is willing to be patient with me."
"837","cue","00:43:22,520","00:43:26,640","And the more closer we get
to the outside world,"
"838","cue","00:43:26,720","00:43:28,640","the more excited I get."
"839","cue","00:43:28,720","00:43:31,800","You are the last thing I think about
when I go to sleep"
"840","cue","00:43:31,880","00:43:34,400","and the first thing I think about
when I wake up."

it comes pretty natural to me, so…"

"853","cue","00:44:20,520","00:44:21,920","I would like to couple up this girl"
"854","cue","00:44:22,000","00:44:24,920","because she's very adventurous
and I love that."
"855","cue","00:44:25,000","00:44:27,800","She wants to give everything a go,
which I really like about her."
"856","cue","00:44:27,880","00:44:31,080","Um, the sexual attraction and chemistry
is definitely there too."
"857","cue","00:44:31,160","00:44:34,480","And I'm keen to see
where things go in the future."
"858","cue","00:44:36,720","00:44:41,560","So the girl I'd like to couple up with
is Phoebe."
"859","cue","00:44:55,400","00:44:57,040","Well, sexual attraction then."
"860","cue","00:44:57,120","00:45:00,400","[all laughing]"
"861","cue","00:45:00,480","00:45:02,000","-Just a little.
-Okay."
"862","cue","00:45:02,080","00:45:03,960","How do you feel about that, Phoebe?"
"863","cue","00:45:04,040","00:45:07,160","Yeah, I think, um, I've… [laughs]"
"864","cue","00:45:07,800","00:45:11,080","I've found myself to be
a sucker for a mullet maybe."
"865","cue","00:45:11,160","00:45:12,480","[both laugh]"
"866","cue","00:45:12,560","00:45:13,680","[Sophie] Oh, great."
"867","cue","00:45:13,760","00:45:15,200","It's a magic mullet."
"868","cue","00:45:18,560","00:45:22,800","Three girls remaining
and only two boys left."
"869","cue","00:45:25,600","00:45:28,040","Callum, please stand up."
"870","cue","00:45:38,160","00:45:43,880","Callum, which girl would you like
to couple up with and why?"
"871","cue","00:45:44,440","00:45:46,440","Um, I would like to couple up
with this girl"
"872","cue","00:45:46,520","00:45:48,480","because I feel like
over the last couple of days,"
"873","cue","00:45:48,560","00:45:50,440","she's put a big effort in
to get to know me."
"874","cue","00:45:50,520","00:45:53,120","Our conversations
have been flowing very well."
"875","cue","00:45:54,120","00:45:57,360","I believe she's had a rocky start
to her <i>Love Island</i> journey,"
"876","cue","00:45:57,440","00:46:00,040","but I genuinely believe
she's in here for the right reasons."
"877","cue","00:46:02,920","00:46:04,960","The girl I'd like to couple up with is…"
"878","cue","00:46:15,080","00:46:17,680","-Maddy.
-[exhales heavily]"
"879","cue","00:46:26,680","00:46:27,680","-[kisses]
-Thank you."
"880","cue","00:46:35,920","00:46:37,520","Gosh, I never know what's gonna happen."
"881","cue","00:46:37,600","00:46:38,800","[all laugh]"
"882","cue","00:46:39,920","00:46:41,920","Maddy, you looked a bit shocked."
"883","cue","00:46:42,000","00:46:45,040","-Were you?
-Yeah, um, I was shocked."
"884","cue","00:46:45,120","00:46:48,320","I sort of prepared myself
for the worst-case scenario."
"885","cue","00:46:48,400","00:46:50,840","But I'm very, very happy
with the decision."
"886","cue","00:46:50,920","00:46:53,080","-So, thank you, Callum.
-Yeah."
"887","cue","00:47:08,760","00:47:10,320","Vakoo and Stella,"
"888","cue","00:47:11,960","00:47:15,920","I'm afraid to say one of you
will be dumped from the island tonight."
"889","cue","00:47:21,360","00:47:23,640","Tak, please stand up."
"890","cue","00:47:24,440","00:47:25,720","[exhales heavily, clears throat]"
"891","cue","00:47:34,120","00:47:36,000","I know this is gonna be very hard,"
"892","cue","00:47:36,640","00:47:41,440","but I have to ask you which girl would
you like to couple up with and why?"
"893","cue","00:47:49,760","00:47:52,280","I would like to couple up with this girl
because…"
"894","cue","00:47:55,800","00:47:58,960","ever since I first talked to her, um…"
"895","cue","00:48:01,600","00:48:04,520","you know, I feel like our conversations
have always flowed."
"896","cue","00:48:07,640","00:48:09,640","And I think she's truly beautiful."
"897","cue","00:48:11,400","00:48:13,320","I think she deserves the world and…"
"898","cue","00:48:14,480","00:48:16,640","I really want to try
and get to know her better."
"899","cue","00:48:17,640","00:48:19,480","So… [exhales heavily]"
"900","cue","00:48:21,040","00:48:24,080","…the girl that I would
like to couple up with tonight is…"
"901","cue","00:48:42,960","00:48:43,960","Stella."
"902","cue","00:49:01,080","00:49:03,600","Tak, that must have been
so difficult for you."
"903","cue","00:49:04,400","00:49:07,000","Um, it definitely wasn't an easy decision."
"904","cue","00:49:08,800","00:49:09,800","Yeah, it--"
"905","cue","00:49:10,520","00:49:11,680","Not easy."
"906","cue","00:49:16,520","00:49:20,240","Vakoo, this is the hard bit
and the sad bit. I'm sorry."
"907","cue","00:49:20,320","00:49:21,400","It's okay."
"908","cue","00:49:21,480","00:49:23,360","-[Sophie] How do you feel?
-I feel fine."
"909","cue","00:49:23,440","00:49:24,520","-Do you?
-[Vakoo laughs]"
"910","cue","00:49:24,600","00:49:25,600","[Sophie] Aw."
"911","cue","00:49:25,680","00:49:28,520","I don't wanna cry.
I've cried every single day here."
"912","cue","00:49:28,600","00:49:29,760","It's not easy, is it?"
"913","cue","00:49:29,840","00:49:32,760","Yeah, it's a lot, but I'm proud of myself."
"914","cue","00:49:32,840","00:49:35,960","I went for what I thought I wanted."
"915","cue","00:49:36,040","00:49:37,840","It bit me in the ass, but it's okay."
"916","cue","00:49:37,920","00:49:40,240","-It's part of the experience.
-[Sophie] Yeah, that's right."
"917","cue","00:49:40,320","00:49:43,680","Everyone will be sliding into your DMs
when you get home, don't you worry."
"918","cue","00:49:43,760","00:49:46,480","-I'm so sexy. It's okay.
-[all laugh]"
"919","cue","00:49:46,560","00:49:49,280","[Sophie] That is so true.
You've got no issues."
"920","cue","00:49:49,360","00:49:50,480","It's okay."
"921","cue","00:49:55,320","00:49:58,200","Well, Vakoo, unfortunately,
you have been left single."
"922","cue","00:49:59,160","00:50:01,320","Which means you are dumped
from the island."
"923","cue","00:50:03,320","00:50:06,840","You have 30 minutes
to pack up and say goodbye."
"924","cue","00:50:07,640","00:50:09,160","It's been amazing watching you."
"925","cue","00:50:09,240","00:50:10,640","-Thank you.
-Okay."
"926","cue","00:50:11,200","00:50:13,760","The rest of you, I'll see you very soon."
"927","cue","00:50:14,960","00:50:16,440","-Bye.
-[Mitchell] Bye, Sophie."
"928","cue","00:50:16,520","00:50:17,400","[Al] Bye, Sophie."
"929","cue","00:50:21,600","00:50:23,080","I love you so much."
"930","cue","00:50:24,920","00:50:26,160","I'm happy for you."
"931","cue","00:50:27,160","00:50:30,080","-[crying] I just-- God.
-No, it's fine."
"932","cue","00:50:30,160","00:50:31,600","I'm happy you were with me."
"933","cue","00:50:31,680","00:50:34,000","[Claudia] Holy shit. Wow."
"934","cue","00:50:35,240","00:50:37,800","[Phoebe] You deserve way more time
than you got, my girl."
"935","cue","00:50:37,880","00:50:40,040","I thought so, but you know."
"936","cue","00:50:40,720","00:50:43,040","[Jess] Dude, you fucking
made an impact, that's for sure."
"937","cue","00:50:43,640","00:50:47,360","Vak really came in like an atomic bomb."
"938","cue","00:50:47,440","00:50:50,800","She shook the villa
and turned it on its head."
"939","cue","00:50:50,880","00:50:54,200","And she looked damn good doing it."
"940","cue","00:50:54,280","00:50:56,800","-I'm gonna miss you guys.
-[Maddy] We're gonna miss you too."
"941","cue","00:50:56,880","00:50:59,080","I am definitely sad to see Vakoo go."
"942","cue","00:50:59,160","00:51:01,040","I genuinely think that she's a top bird"
"943","cue","00:51:01,120","00:51:03,800","and she's made a big impact in here
in a short amount of time."
"944","cue","00:51:03,880","00:51:06,160","-I'm just gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you too."
"945","cue","00:51:06,240","00:51:08,320","Thank you for putting
a smile on my face, and…"
"946","cue","00:51:13,320","00:51:16,000","-Um, yeah, I can't thank you enough.
-That's so sweet."
"947","cue","00:51:16,080","00:51:17,320","Come give me a hug."
"948","cue","00:51:17,400","00:51:18,920","Thanks, Callum."
"949","cue","00:51:19,000","00:51:20,680","-Thank you, Vakoo.
-I appreciate you."
"950","cue","00:51:21,600","00:51:24,440","It was hard to say goodbye to Vak and sad."
"951","cue","00:51:25,000","00:51:26,720","The time that I had with her was short"
"952","cue","00:51:26,800","00:51:31,480","and I'm sure if it had been different,
it would have been great."
"953","cue","00:51:31,560","00:51:36,240","But, you know, at the end of the day
you can only follow your heart."
"954","cue","00:51:36,880","00:51:39,880","I just wanted you to know
that wasn't an easy decision."
"955","cue","00:51:41,920","00:51:45,000","Made the choice
that you know is good for you."
"956","cue","00:51:45,080","00:51:46,080","Mm-hmm."
"957","cue","00:51:46,600","00:51:48,800","How am I gonna be mad
when I did the same thing?"
"958","cue","00:51:48,880","00:51:51,840","You just have to follow what you feel here"
"959","cue","00:51:51,920","00:51:55,320","and obviously you just feel stronger
towards Stella."
"960","cue","00:51:55,400","00:51:59,440","She's amazing.
I wish you both nothing but the best."
"961","cue","00:51:59,520","00:52:01,400","Things definitely
would have been different"
"962","cue","00:52:01,480","00:52:03,320","if I had just chosen Tak
from the beginning."
"963","cue","00:52:03,400","00:52:05,360","But I don't regret my choice."
"964","cue","00:52:05,440","00:52:07,360","I followed my gut."
"965","cue","00:52:07,440","00:52:08,880","I followed my heart."
"966","cue","00:52:09,680","00:52:13,080","Followed my fanny flutters. [laughs]"
"967","cue","00:52:13,160","00:52:15,400","And it got me dumped. [laughs]"
"968","cue","00:52:16,840","00:52:18,680","[Phoebe] Yeah. This is really sad."
"969","cue","00:52:19,360","00:52:21,200","-[Vakoo] I love you guys.
-We love you."
"970","cue","00:52:21,280","00:52:22,640","-[Jordan] Much love.
-Bye."
"971","cue","00:52:22,720","00:52:24,480","-See you later.
-[Vakoo] Okay."
"972","cue","00:52:24,560","00:52:26,720","-[Stella] See you soon, baby.
-Bye."
"973","cue","00:52:28,120","00:52:29,800","-Bye!
-[Al] Bye!"
"974","cue","00:52:34,520","00:52:36,800","[Vakoo] I feel pretty good, actually,
about leaving single,"
"975","cue","00:52:36,880","00:52:41,360","just because I stuck to what I believed in
and went for what I wanted."
"976","cue","00:52:41,440","00:52:45,240","I came in, I caused havoc
and I had a good time doing it."
