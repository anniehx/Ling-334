into a text message,"
"681","cue","00:35:28,000","00:35:29,520","so I'd call her straightaway"

as soon as I come out"

you guys are, um, madly in love."

"841","cue","00:42:52,880","00:42:54,640","-They deserve it, honestly.
-They deserve it."
"842","cue","00:42:54,720","00:42:55,560","They smashed it."
"843","cue","00:42:55,640","00:42:57,680","-Thank you.
-Love you. Love you."
"844","cue","00:42:59,120","00:43:02,680","Give it up for Phoebe and Mitchell
and Madeline and Callum."
"845","cue","00:43:02,760","00:43:04,920","-[guests cheering]
-[Sophie] Well done, guys."
"846","cue","00:43:06,920","00:43:10,240","-Okay, guys. Congratulations.
-Thank you."
"847","cue","00:43:10,320","00:43:11,320","How are you feeling?"
"848","cue","00:43:11,400","00:43:13,680","[chuckles] I'm over the moon.
I can't believe it."
"849","cue","00:43:13,760","00:43:15,480","-I genuinely cannot believe it.
-Yeah?"
"850","cue","00:43:15,560","00:43:17,000","-I know.
-How are you feeling?"
"851","cue","00:43:17,080","00:43:19,360","I'm lost for words.
I don't even know what to say."
"852","cue","00:43:19,440","00:43:20,920","I mean, how do you-- I don't--"
"853","cue","00:43:21,000","00:43:23,120","Okay, don't celebrate too early"
"854","cue","00:43:23,200","00:43:26,200","because, Austen and Claudia,"
"855","cue","00:43:26,800","00:43:29,600","you found a beautiful connection
with each other."
"856","cue","00:43:29,680","00:43:31,720","But one question remains."
"857","cue","00:43:32,920","00:43:36,840","Were you here for love,
or were you here for money?"
"858","cue","00:43:38,000","00:43:42,760","Do you plan to split the cash, or
would you rather walk away with the love?"
"859","cue","00:43:44,000","00:43:45,880","The basket of eggs, please."
"860","cue","00:43:47,640","00:43:48,600","Thank you, Anita."
"861","cue","00:43:50,560","00:43:55,640","So, we've heard a lot about all your eggs
being in each other's baskets."
"862","cue","00:43:56,360","00:43:59,360","Now we will find out
if it was actually true."
"863","cue","00:44:01,000","00:44:04,280","In this basket there are two golden eggs."
"864","cue","00:44:05,360","00:44:08,840","-Take your pick, whichever one you want.
-[Austen chuckles]"
"865","cue","00:44:12,440","00:44:16,760","Now, one of these eggs
has got $0 written on it."
"866","cue","00:44:17,960","00:44:21,760","The other, $50,000."
"867","cue","00:44:25,320","00:44:30,120","If you pick that egg,
you'll face the ultimate question."
"868","cue","00:44:30,200","00:44:32,200","Love or money?"
"869","cue","00:44:33,800","00:44:36,120","Okay, Austen,
let's see what you got there."
"870","cue","00:44:37,480","00:44:40,360","-Ooh. Zero dollars, Austen.
-Nothing."
"871","cue","00:44:40,440","00:44:41,720","[inhales sharply]"
"872","cue","00:44:41,800","00:44:44,240","Claudia, let's see your egg."
"873","cue","00:44:44,320","00:44:48,240","-I got 50K.
-$50,000."
"874","cue","00:44:48,320","00:44:50,240","[cheering]"
"875","cue","00:44:52,600","00:44:53,920","[chuckling]"
"876","cue","00:44:54,000","00:44:54,960","Claudia,"
"877","cue","00:44:55,760","00:45:00,320","that $50,000 is currently all yours."
"878","cue","00:45:01,600","00:45:04,840","Choose money,
and you leave with every cent."
"879","cue","00:45:06,120","00:45:09,280","Choose love,
and you'll share it with Austen."
"880","cue","00:45:09,360","00:45:11,560","So, Claudia,"
"881","cue","00:45:12,480","00:45:16,200","do you choose love,
or do you choose money?"
"882","cue","00:45:16,280","00:45:19,920","So, I'm definitely not taking the money.
I just want you."
"883","cue","00:45:20,000","00:45:22,520","[laughing, squeals]"
"884","cue","00:45:22,600","00:45:24,600","Make it official. What do you choose?"
"885","cue","00:45:24,680","00:45:25,720","Love!"
"886","cue","00:45:26,320","00:45:27,760","-Love.
-Love."
"887","cue","00:45:27,840","00:45:29,280","Love wins."
"888","cue","00:45:29,360","00:45:31,160","[all cheering]"
"889","cue","00:45:42,080","00:45:43,600","Well, there you go."
"890","cue","00:45:44,240","00:45:47,480","Their eggs were really
in each other's baskets."
"891","cue","00:45:48,000","00:45:50,520","What a season this has been."
"892","cue","00:45:50,600","00:45:52,520","Thank you to our Islanders."
"893","cue","00:45:52,600","00:45:56,480","Thank you to Spain for our banging tans,
even though mine's fake."
"894","cue","00:45:57,400","00:45:59,680","But most of all, thank you to you"
"895","cue","00:45:59,760","00:46:03,240","for watching across Australia
and across the world."
"896","cue","00:46:03,760","00:46:05,560","Love wins, everyone."
"897","cue","00:46:05,640","00:46:07,920","[cheering continues]"
