"342","cue","00:17:17,720","00:17:21,599","I haven't been in many serious
relationships. I've been in a couple."
"343","cue","00:17:21,680","00:17:24,520","So my last relationship
was actually recent."
"344","cue","00:17:25,640","00:17:27,240","A few months ago, you know?"
"345","cue","00:17:27,319","00:17:30,280","It was cool. We just
didn't see eye to eye on some things."
"346","cue","00:17:30,360","00:17:32,360","-And we just broke off that way.
-Yeah."
"347","cue","00:17:32,440","00:17:35,160","-And then what about you?
-I'm big on personality."
"348","cue","00:17:35,240","00:17:38,200","-Yeah.
-So I like someone who has banter."
"349","cue","00:17:38,280","00:17:40,520","And someone who's just genuine,
down-to-earth."
"350","cue","00:17:41,720","00:17:43,360","In a relationship,
I'm really into loyalty."
"351","cue","00:17:43,440","00:17:45,280","Good. Yeah, that's a good sign."
"352","cue","00:17:45,360","00:17:47,720","How about you?
What do you look for in a girl?"
"353","cue","00:17:47,800","00:17:50,400","The same way.
They definitely need to be loyal."
"354","cue","00:17:50,480","00:17:52,240","Like you said. Trustworthy."
"355","cue","00:17:52,960","00:17:54,760","Respectful.
I don't like being disrespected."
"356","cue","00:17:54,840","00:17:56,080","-Yeah, same.
-Yeah."
"357","cue","00:17:56,160","00:17:59,040","-That's a big one for me. [chuckles]
-Tick. [chuckles]"
"358","cue","00:17:59,720","00:18:02,240","-How's it been so far? Yeah.
-How's it been?"
"359","cue","00:18:02,320","00:18:04,680","At the moment, I'm coupled up with Al."
"360","cue","00:18:05,360","00:18:07,400","-I don't know--
-Why do you say it like that?"
"361","cue","00:18:07,480","00:18:08,720","[chuckling]"
"362","cue","00:18:10,120","00:18:15,000","Um-- No, we're going good. We are.
We are going good."
"363","cue","00:18:15,080","00:18:18,280","-But obviously, we're both still open…
-Yeah."
"364","cue","00:18:18,360","00:18:20,640","…to get to know whoever
walks in through the door."
"365","cue","00:18:20,720","00:18:22,960","And obviously you're very good-looking."
"366","cue","00:18:23,040","00:18:25,960","So, are you interested now
that someone came in? [chuckles]"
"367","cue","00:18:26,040","00:18:29,320","I mean, look,
obviously, I want to get to know you."
"368","cue","00:18:30,440","00:18:31,760","So, yeah."
"369","cue","00:18:33,880","00:18:37,920","Just wanted to talk to you about,
you know, what you think Jess is doing."
"370","cue","00:18:38,000","00:18:40,560","-Yeah, fuck, bro.
-You reckon I should be worried?"
"371","cue","00:18:40,640","00:18:42,960","Jess has been away for ages now."
"372","cue","00:18:43,040","00:18:44,520","And not gonna lie,"
"373","cue","00:18:44,600","00:18:49,000","I've been thinking about what the heck
she's doing, what she's saying."
"374","cue","00:18:49,080","00:18:51,120","It's just been Jess, Jess, Jess."
"375","cue","00:18:51,200","00:18:53,600","What's gonna be the red flag
when she enters the villa?"
"376","cue","00:18:53,680","00:18:55,560","-What are you looking for?
-I'm looking--"
"377","cue","00:18:55,640","00:18:58,960","I'm looking for, when she first enters
the villa, if she's holding his hand."
"378","cue","00:18:59,040","00:19:02,720","Okay. Well, you know,
there's actually a psychology trick."
"379","cue","00:19:02,800","00:19:05,960","If they hold it like this, it means
they're really into each other."
"380","cue","00:19:06,040","00:19:08,680","-If they hold it like this, they're not.
-Ah."
"381","cue","00:19:08,760","00:19:11,920","-Yeah. Yeah. [chuckles]
-Okay. I'm looking for that or that."
"382","cue","00:19:12,000","00:19:14,240","So if they're holding hands,
it doesn't mean--"
"383","cue","00:19:14,320","00:19:16,240","Doesn't matter,
as long as they're holding like this."
"384","cue","00:19:16,320","00:19:18,680","You want it like this.
If it's like this, that's bad news."
"385","cue","00:19:18,760","00:19:21,720","-Yeah. Yeah, hundred percent.

"508","cue","00:24:49,000","00:24:53,560","So, answer me this honestly.
Do you think Austen is in trouble?"
"509","cue","00:24:54,400","00:24:55,520","I don't know."
"510","cue","00:24:56,080","00:24:58,360","-[Mitch] How do you feel?
-I'm fine."
"511","cue","00:24:58,440","00:25:00,760","-Yeah?
-Obviously, it's a worry."
"512","cue","00:25:00,840","00:25:02,600","-But there's no point of worrying.
-[Al] Yeah."
"513","cue","00:25:02,680","00:25:04,440","If she's gonna go for him,
she's gonna go for him."

-What am I gonna do? ""No, don't."

"518","cue","00:25:13,600","00:25:17,280","-Yeah, but she left him for a reason.
-I don't say I'm the jealous type,"
"519","cue","00:25:17,360","00:25:21,160","but if I knew that,
I would be less calm than you, bro."
"520","cue","00:25:21,240","00:25:22,720","I'd be a bit jealous for sure."
"521","cue","00:25:22,800","00:25:23,720","Fuck."
"522","cue","00:25:23,800","00:25:26,080","-[Al] She's solid, but--
-[Tak] No, I think you'll be fine, bro."
"523","cue","00:25:26,160","00:25:29,280","I'm just keeping an open mind.
That's kind of how I'm doing it."
"524","cue","00:25:29,360","00:25:32,960","This is my theory. If she ends up
going with him, that's fine."
"525","cue","00:25:33,040","00:25:36,880","I-- I'm-- I wanted to--
I'm happy with my <i>Love Island</i> experience."
"526","cue","00:25:36,960","00:25:39,600","I wouldn't have changed it for anything."
"527","cue","00:25:39,680","00:25:41,480","But don't talk like that."
"528","cue","00:25:41,560","00:25:43,760","-No, I know.
-[Mitch] Yeah. Don't talk like that."
"529","cue","00:25:44,520","00:25:47,440","I am playing it very cool,
just because I don't really--"
"530","cue","00:25:48,360","00:25:50,560","Obviously it's going to fucking
eat me alive"
"531","cue","00:25:50,640","00:25:53,080","if they end up talking
and rekindling and stuff."
"532","cue","00:25:53,160","00:25:55,320","But then again,
I can't stop what she's feeling."
"533","cue","00:25:55,400","00:25:56,840","If she is drawn to him again"
"534","cue","00:25:56,920","00:26:00,400","and thinks that there could be
a possibility there, then so be it."
"535","cue","00:26:00,480","00:26:02,640","But obviously I want her to stay with me."
"536","cue","00:26:02,720","00:26:04,960","I'm not getting ready at all.
I'm gonna look ugly."
"537","cue","00:26:12,440","00:26:13,600","Do you wanna chat?"
"538","cue","00:26:13,680","00:26:14,960","-If you want.
-Yes."
"539","cue","00:26:15,040","00:26:19,080","It's such an uncomfortable situation.
I don't want Austen to be uncomfortable."
"540","cue","00:26:19,920","00:26:22,520","But I think he is hiding
his jealousy a little bit."
"541","cue","00:26:23,280","00:26:24,480","-Yes.
-How are you feeling?"
"542","cue","00:26:24,560","00:26:25,600","-I'm fine.
-Are you?"
"543","cue","00:26:25,680","00:26:27,240","-I think we jinxed ourselves.
-Why?"
"544","cue","00:26:27,320","00:26:29,840","-'Cause it's a bit of a curveball.
-Yeah. I know. It is."
"545","cue","00:26:29,920","00:26:31,400","I heard down the grapevine"
"546","cue","00:26:31,480","00:26:33,480","that you were concerned
about when we broke up."
"547","cue","00:26:33,560","00:26:35,080","Yeah, I did say that."
"548","cue","00:26:35,160","00:26:38,720","Look, it was three months ago,
and that's still pretty fresh."
"549","cue","00:26:38,800","00:26:40,440","-It was fresh.
-Yeah."
"550","cue","00:26:40,520","00:26:43,240","-But obviously I did that for a reason.
-That's what I said."
"551","cue","00:26:43,320","00:26:44,560","-Yeah, I know.
-You know?"
"552","cue","00:26:44,640","00:26:49,000","Jason and I broke up
because he went to America."
"553","cue","00:26:49,080","00:26:51,240","So we had a fight when he went to America."
"554","cue","00:26:51,320","00:26:52,960","-Right.
-And I didn't talk to him."
"555","cue","00:26:53,040","00:26:54,040","He didn't talk to me."
"556","cue","00:26:54,120","00:26:59,720","Then found out that he
started following on Instagram some exes,"
"557","cue","00:27:00,360","00:27:02,840","and I didn't like the disrespect,
so I ended it."
"558","cue","00:27:02,920","00:27:06,240","That's when I broke it off with him,
because I was like, ""What the fuck?"""
"559","cue","00:27:06,320","00:27:07,520","Are you upset?"
"560","cue","00:27:08,400","00:27:10,880","Uh, I don't know. Half and half."
"561","cue","00:27:10,960","00:27:14,400","I feel like, as well, a little bit…"
"562","cue","00:27:15,440","00:27:17,760","a wall has been a little bit
put up as well."
"563","cue","00:27:18,280","00:27:19,880","-A wall for you? Why?
-Yeah."
"564","cue","00:27:19,960","00:27:24,680","Just in case. 'Cause this happens on
the outside world, it does happen a lot."
"565","cue","00:27:24,760","00:27:27,200","That's why when you say,
""How do girls leave you?"""
"566","cue","00:27:27,280","00:27:29,320","It's 'cause of the exes."
"567","cue","00:27:29,400","00:27:32,480","But in saying that, I'm still trusting you
but it's only a little wall."
"568","cue","00:27:32,560","00:27:35,520","It's just in case.
You got nothing to worry about."
"569","cue","00:27:36,200","00:27:38,800","It's only just a little one. Okay?"
"570","cue","00:27:45,000","00:27:47,200","[Claudia]

"674","cue","00:32:33,240","00:32:35,480","-We'll have to speak and see.
-Nothing else?"
"675","cue","00:32:35,560","00:32:37,640","-Nothing else. Yeah.
-Okay."
"676","cue","00:32:37,720","00:32:40,160","I think it's a conversation
me and her need to have privately."
"677","cue","00:32:40,240","00:32:43,000","-Yeah.
-Claudia was giving me the death stare."
"678","cue","00:32:44,120","00:32:46,560","I used to see that death stare probably
on a daily basis,"
"679","cue","00:32:46,640","00:32:48,400","so it's nothing new. I can handle it."
"680","cue","00:32:49,120","00:32:54,120","There's some stuff that we both need
to get off of our chests."

-[Jason] No."

-No."

-[Jason] Yeah, let's go."

-Nice to meet you."
"697","cue","00:33:34,560","00:33:37,000","-Let's go for boys chat.
-[contestants] Yeah."
"698","cue","00:33:37,080","00:33:38,200","-A boys chat.
-Let's go."
"699","cue","00:33:38,280","00:33:40,440","[Callum]
You met the girls, now meet the boys."
"700","cue","00:33:40,520","00:33:43,600","I think he is quite a few
of the girls in here's type"
"701","cue","00:33:43,680","00:33:45,680","so some of the boys should be stressing."
"702","cue","00:33:46,360","00:33:48,880","[Mitch]
So, brother. Tell us about yourself."
"703","cue","00:33:49,440","00:33:52,280","-Bro, 25.
-[Mitch] Twenty-five."
"704","cue","00:33:52,360","00:33:54,560","Obviously you guys
can probably hear the accent."
"705","cue","00:33:54,640","00:33:55,600","-American.
-American."
"706","cue","00:33:55,680","00:33:57,960","-[Mitch] Where about you from? Florida?
-Florida."
"707","cue","00:33:58,040","00:33:59,960","-Yeah.
-What do you think your red flags are?"
"708","cue","00:34:00,040","00:34:01,360","-Of your own.
-Of my own?"
"709","cue","00:34:01,440","00:34:04,400","-Yeah.
-Probably being like nonchalant."
"710","cue","00:34:04,480","00:34:07,440","-What's a ""chalant?""
-That's a vegetable."
"711","cue","00:34:07,520","00:34:09,400","It means they could do something,
you're just like…"
"712","cue","00:34:09,480","00:34:10,920","-[Mitch] You're not a jealous type?
-No."
"713","cue","00:34:11,000","00:34:12,120","-[Tak] Nonchalant.
-[Mitch] Really?"
"714","cue","00:34:12,199","00:34:13,960","I swear that's a vegetable."
"715","cue","00:34:14,040","00:34:16,800","So when he's saying, ""I'm nonchalant,""
the sentence didn't make sense to me."
"716","cue","00:34:16,880","00:34:19,639","I didn't want to butt into him,
'cause obviously he's talking,"
"717","cue","00:34:19,719","00:34:22,520","but yeah,
he may have got his words mixed up."
"718","cue","00:34:22,600","00:34:25,520","[Mitch] If you don't mind me asking,
how was your relationship with Claudia?"
"719","cue","00:34:25,600","00:34:27,960","-We were very close at the time.
-[Mitch] Yeah."
"720","cue","00:34:28,040","00:34:29,679","[Jason]
Pretty much spent every day together."
"721","cue","00:34:29,760","00:34:31,639","So the relationship was good,
I'm not gonna lie."
"722","cue","00:34:31,719","00:34:32,920","We had a good relationship."
"723","cue","00:34:33,000","00:34:34,880","-I think distance kind of just…
-[Tak] Yeah."
"724","cue","00:34:34,960","00:34:36,040","…separated us a little bit."
"725","cue","00:34:36,120","00:34:39,560","-[Mitch] You guys haven't talked since?
-No, we spoke after."
"726","cue","00:34:39,639","00:34:41,280","We spent some time together after."
"727","cue","00:34:41,360","00:34:44,760","I know Austen,
and he's definitely a bit rattled here."
"728","cue","00:34:44,840","00:34:48,719","So when's the last time you spoke to her
or hung out with her before coming here?"
"729","cue","00:34:48,800","00:34:51,880","Yeah, it was probably right
before she came in here."
"730","cue","00:34:51,960","00:34:53,040","Fuck. All right."
"731","cue","00:34:53,120","00:34:54,840","-Shit.
-Interesting."
"732","cue","00:34:55,639","00:34:56,639","It's fucking interesting."
"733","cue","00:34:56,719","00:34:59,960","Can I trust Jason? I want to say no."
"734","cue","00:35:00,040","00:35:03,120","I purely think Jason came here
just to get Claudia back."
"735","cue","00:35:03,200","00:35:04,720","-I'm with Claudia.
-Yeah."
"736","cue","00:35:04,800","00:35:07,480","-We're both pretty set on each other.
-Yeah."
"737","cue","00:35:07,560","00:35:09,800","-I think she's, uh--
-Shh. They're trying to listen."
"738","cue","00:35:09,880","00:35:11,920","-[Callum] They're trying to listen.
-[Jordan] Don't listen."
"739","cue","00:35:12,000","00:35:13,320","Stop listening."
"740","cue","00:35:13,400","00:35:15,400","-[Jess] All right. This is boring.
-It's so boring."
"741","cue","00:35:17,880","00:35:19,680","Yeah, no, it's been fucking good, bro."
"742","cue","00:35:19,760","00:35:22,000","-She's a beautiful girl. A beautiful soul.
-Hundred percent."
"743","cue","00:35:22,080","00:35:24,480","How do you feel me coming in?
For you, it's different--"
"744","cue","00:35:24,560","00:35:26,640","Yeah, I've got a lot
of confidence in myself."
"745","cue","00:35:26,720","00:35:27,800","A hundred percent."
"746","cue","00:35:27,880","00:35:31,200","Obviously, you know, Claudia's mine.
And if you get her,"
"747","cue","00:35:31,280","00:35:33,040","-I'm gonna have to fight you.
-[chuckles]"
"748","cue","00:35:33,120","00:35:34,480","Well, it is what it is."
"749","cue","00:35:34,560","00:35:35,640","Ooh!"
"750","cue","00:35:35,720","00:35:38,080","I would love a fight.
I'm not turning down from anything."
"751","cue","00:35:38,160","00:35:42,080","I've dated Claudia for a year.
Austen's dated her for three weeks."
"752","cue","00:35:42,160","00:35:44,240","I don't really think
there's a fight there."
"753","cue","00:35:45,480","00:35:47,160","Fucking hell, you're talk of the town."
"754","cue","00:35:47,240","00:35:48,080","Sorry?"
"755","cue","00:35:48,160","00:35:49,800","-You look good.
-Shut up."
"756","cue","00:35:50,440","00:35:53,560","The last time I saw Claudia,
it didn't end on the best of terms."
"757","cue","00:35:53,640","00:35:55,480","I am here to resolve
some of the unfinished business"
"758","cue","00:35:55,560","00:35:56,720","'cause we did have a connection."
"759","cue","00:35:56,800","00:35:58,240","-You have shit in your eye.
-Oh."
"760","cue","00:35:59,360","00:36:00,800","-Thanks.
-Yeah."
"761","cue","00:36:01,440","00:36:04,240","Listen, I made your mom a promise.
Get this out the way, right?"
"762","cue","00:36:04,320","00:36:07,560","-I saw her recently.
-I really want to know. Are they all okay?"
"763","cue","00:36:07,640","00:36:09,440","This is the promise. I told her…"
"764","cue","00:36:09,520","00:36:12,080","-Wait, stop.
-That's from your mom."
"765","cue","00:36:12,800","00:36:15,600","Everyone is okay.
That was a little bit from me too."
"766","cue","00:36:15,680","00:36:17,800","But everyone is okay."
"767","cue","00:36:17,880","00:36:20,400","-I knew you'd be worried about it.
-I was so worried about them."
"768","cue","00:36:20,480","00:36:23,240","-I hang out with your family all the time.
-Do you actually?"
"769","cue","00:36:23,320","00:36:25,360","Yeah. Me and your mom speak
four times a week."
"770","cue","00:36:25,920","00:36:27,960","-Literally. Swear to God.
-Are you serious?"
"771","cue","00:36:29,640","00:36:32,240","-Stop. Come here.
-No, I don't wanna go to you."
"772","cue","00:36:32,320","00:36:33,400","Don't cry."
"773","cue","00:36:34,840","00:36:36,880","I think Claudia was putting
on a little bit of a front."
"774","cue","00:36:36,960","00:36:39,080","I think deep down she is happy to see me."
"775","cue","00:36:39,160","00:36:42,200","Why are you here? I don't understand."
"776","cue","00:36:42,280","00:36:44,720","Are you here for me, or just to find love?"
"777","cue","00:36:44,800","00:36:46,600","Listen…"
"778","cue","00:36:46,680","00:36:47,880","yeah, to find love."
"779","cue","00:36:47,960","00:36:51,040","-You know what I mean. Shut up!
-Come here. Stop fucking crying."

-Don't. [sniffs]"
"781","cue","00:36:53,760","00:36:56,040","I told you I speak to your mom.
You know what she said to me?"
"782","cue","00:36:56,120","00:36:58,280","This is what she said to me. She said,"
"783","cue","00:36:58,360","00:37:01,600","""Jason, you and her paths

'cause obviously,"

especially my mom."
"786","cue","00:37:08,240","00:37:10,640","My mom's opinion is everything to me."
"787","cue","00:37:10,720","00:37:14,240","-Jason, I'm really good with Austen.
-But listen to me, also--"
"788","cue","00:37:14,320","00:37:16,960","I'm just telling you Austen
and I are like this."
"789","cue","00:37:17,040","00:37:20,120","He is absolutely
every single thing that I want."
"790","cue","00:37:20,200","00:37:22,080","Everything to a T."
"791","cue","00:37:22,160","00:37:24,920","It's the same story.
Two people come, they meet each other,"
"792","cue","00:37:25,440","00:37:27,520","they're in love for three weeks."
"793","cue","00:37:27,600","00:37:29,680","You know,
it's like-- it's-- it's not real."
"794","cue","00:37:29,760","00:37:31,840","Everything's happy. Whatever."
"795","cue","00:37:31,920","00:37:34,080","And then where
are those people a year later?"
"796","cue","00:37:37,360","00:37:40,080","Obviously there's always gonna be
feelings for Jason."
"797","cue","00:37:40,160","00:37:43,920","But I am not here for Jason.
I'm here to find someone new."

"841","cue","00:39:35,600","00:39:37,160","to see if the stories add up."
"842","cue","00:39:37,240","00:39:38,520","And if something's not adding up,"
"843","cue","00:39:38,600","00:39:40,880","I'm not good at maths, but I know
when something's not adding up."
"844","cue","00:39:40,960","00:39:43,080","-How are you feeling?
-Fine."
"845","cue","00:39:43,160","00:39:46,320","-A bit weird. Uncomfortable. But fine.
-Feeling uncomfortable?"
"846","cue","00:39:46,400","00:39:48,720","That's probably normal,
given your circumstances."
"847","cue","00:39:48,800","00:39:51,240","-Yeah.
-So, when did you stop talking then?"
"848","cue","00:39:51,320","00:39:52,520","-Me and him?
-Yeah."
"849","cue","00:39:52,600","00:39:55,400","-Him and I broke up a few months ago.
-A few months ago?"
"850","cue","00:39:55,480","00:39:56,920","What's a few months ago?"
"851","cue","00:39:57,000","00:39:58,880","Like a few months ago,
maybe three months ago."
"852","cue","00:39:58,960","00:40:01,520","Okay. So, three months ago
since you came in here?"
"853","cue","00:40:01,600","00:40:03,240","-I don't actually know a hundred percent.
-Okay."
"854","cue","00:40:03,320","00:40:06,680","But I swear I stopped speaking
to him a few weeks"
"855","cue","00:40:06,760","00:40:09,840","before I got to Majorca."
"856","cue","00:40:10,560","00:40:12,240","Three months since you got to Majorca?"
"857","cue","00:40:12,320","00:40:14,080","A few weeks before I got to Majorca."
"858","cue","00:40:14,160","00:40:16,680","-A few weeks?
-Because we were still talking like exes."
"859","cue","00:40:16,760","00:40:17,640","You're talking shit."
"860","cue","00:40:17,720","00:40:21,240","She was like, ""Oh, a couple of weeks,
a couple of months and a couple of week""--"
"861","cue","00:40:21,320","00:40:23,560","I was like, is it weeks?
Is it months? Tell me."
"862","cue","00:40:23,640","00:40:24,840","Why did you break up?"
"863","cue","00:40:24,920","00:40:27,080","We were having a lot of fights
about a lot of things"
"864","cue","00:40:27,160","00:40:29,640","-and I was like, ""I can't do this.""
-He was on his way out anyway?"
"865","cue","00:40:29,720","00:40:31,720","-Yes.
-The relationship was on its way out?"
"866","cue","00:40:31,800","00:40:33,960","A few months
before he even went to America,"
"867","cue","00:40:34,040","00:40:37,080","I said, ""We are not staying together."""
"868","cue","00:40:37,160","00:40:38,240","""When you go to America""?"
"869","cue","00:40:38,320","00:40:40,280","A hundred percent,
I was like, ""We're done."""
"870","cue","00:40:40,360","00:40:41,560","Why's he still going to your parents?"
"871","cue","00:40:41,640","00:40:43,840","-I know, I get it.
-That's proper fucked."
"872","cue","00:40:43,920","00:40:47,240","If your parents were for your best
interest, and they know you've broken up,"
"873","cue","00:40:47,320","00:40:49,520","why are they still entertaining
some guy you broke up with"
"874","cue","00:40:49,600","00:40:51,440","-three months later?
-Because it's different."
"875","cue","00:40:51,520","00:40:53,760","-Why is it different?
-He was close to them."
"876","cue","00:40:53,840","00:40:55,920","-Do you know what I mean?
-And you're okay with that?"
"877","cue","00:40:56,000","00:40:57,840","I didn't know. He told me and I was like,
""What the fuck?"""
"878","cue","00:40:57,920","00:40:59,840","So, you didn't know
that leading up to this thing?"
"879","cue","00:40:59,920","00:41:02,400","No. I don't have feelings
for my ex anymore."
"880","cue","00:41:02,480","00:41:05,760","There was obviously--
We have a connection. But I'm done."
"881","cue","00:41:05,840","00:41:08,120","-I broke up with him for a reason.
-Should Austen be threatened?"
"882","cue","00:41:08,200","00:41:10,120","I've told him I'm a hundred percent
for Austen."
"883","cue","00:41:11,720","00:41:15,600","I don't think she's trustworthy at all.
She hasn't proven to me she's trustworthy."
"884","cue","00:41:15,680","00:41:19,000","And the funny thing is,
all she goes on about is trust."
"885","cue","00:41:19,080","00:41:20,640","There's a reason she goes on about trust,"
"886","cue","00:41:20,720","00:41:22,880","is because she knows she
can't trust herself."
"887","cue","00:41:22,960","00:41:24,600","-You went to Florida?
-I went to Florida."
"888","cue","00:41:25,200","00:41:28,200","Was the relationship on its way out
before you went to--"
"889","cue","00:41:28,280","00:41:29,800","Bro, to me, no."
"890","cue","00:41:29,880","00:41:31,920","The first time we said ""I love you""
to each other"
"891","cue","00:41:32,000","00:41:34,200","-was when I was jumping on the plane…
-Really?"
"892","cue","00:41:34,280","00:41:36,040","…to go to Florida. Yeah."
"893","cue","00:41:36,640","00:41:38,520","'Cause she told me she was like,"
"894","cue","00:41:38,600","00:41:40,200","""The relationship was on its way out."""
"895","cue","00:41:40,280","00:41:42,200","And then, she knew, you both knew,"
"896","cue","00:41:42,280","00:41:45,520","apparently, that when you go
to Florida it was going to be over anyway."
"897","cue","00:41:45,600","00:41:48,160","So, obviously she's talking shit"
"898","cue","00:41:48,240","00:41:50,680","because she can't say that
and then say ""I love you"""
"899","cue","00:41:50,760","00:41:52,560","-before you catch a plane. That's fucked.
-Yeah."
"900","cue","00:41:52,640","00:41:54,440","Based on Callum's reactions,"
"901","cue","00:41:54,520","00:41:56,840","it seemed like he was surprised
at the stuff I was saying."
"902","cue","00:41:56,920","00:41:59,840","I think he wanted to get to
the bottom of what really happened."
"903","cue","00:41:59,920","00:42:03,000","Yeah, so then what? You came back
from Florida when?"
"904","cue","00:42:03,080","00:42:05,120","-I was only there for three weeks.
-Okay."
"905","cue","00:42:05,200","00:42:06,320","-Came back after…
-Yeah."
"906","cue","00:42:06,400","00:42:08,000","…left her house, saw her."
"907","cue","00:42:08,080","00:42:10,440","She just told me
that she didn't see you at all."
"908","cue","00:42:10,520","00:42:12,240","She was like, ""I'm going on a flight."""
"909","cue","00:42:12,320","00:42:14,040","I was like,
""I know how you get on flights."""
"910","cue","00:42:14,560","00:42:16,440","I said, ""I'll come with you on the flight,"
"911","cue","00:42:16,520","00:42:18,560","I'll chill with you in Sydney
and I'll fly back."""
"912","cue","00:42:18,640","00:42:21,720","You still talking to her.
But she said she didn't speak to you."
"913","cue","00:42:21,800","00:42:24,560","And then, yeah,
she finished up what she was doing,"
"914","cue","00:42:24,640","00:42:26,640","and we spent the night together."
"915","cue","00:42:27,880","00:42:28,800","Fuck."
"916","cue","00:42:28,880","00:42:31,240","The next morning,
we went to the airport together,"
"917","cue","00:42:31,320","00:42:33,720","-flew back to Adelaide.
-Flew back to Adelaide."
"918","cue","00:42:33,800","00:42:38,120","And then since that day,
the next four days, we were together."
"919","cue","00:42:38,680","00:42:40,720","-[exhales]
-I went to church with her dad."
"920","cue","00:42:42,480","00:42:44,920","-Yeah.
-Are you serious?"
"921","cue","00:42:45,000","00:42:47,920","-So after that--
-We saw each other four days in a row."
"922","cue","00:42:48,000","00:42:52,840","Obviously I viewed Claudia's side.
It's kind of brief."
"923","cue","00:42:52,920","00:42:56,680","She forgot bulk of the story.
And then I've pulled Jason aside,"
"924","cue","00:42:56,760","00:42:59,520","and he's basically spilled the beans
and told me the lot."
"925","cue","00:43:00,280","00:43:02,320","And then she texts me."
"926","cue","00:43:02,400","00:43:05,800","She's like, ""I'm about to do something,
but don't look at me differently after."""
"927","cue","00:43:05,880","00:43:08,080","-You know, so--
-Oh, my-- Yeah."
"928","cue","00:43:08,160","00:43:12,200","So it's almost like to come in here and
when she comes out, she's still got you."
"929","cue","00:43:12,280","00:43:14,680","If she doesn't find love
in here, she's still got you."
"930","cue","00:43:14,760","00:43:18,480","I know Claudia
was telling somewhat of a different story."
"931","cue","00:43:18,560","00:43:20,160","I just didn't know to what extent."
"932","cue","00:43:20,240","00:43:22,120","It is important that my truth
is out there as well"
"933","cue","00:43:22,200","00:43:26,000","because I just wanted to at least come
and let it be heard from my mouth."
"934","cue","00:43:26,080","00:43:28,240","So it's not closed in her head.
She's not closed up."
"935","cue","00:43:28,320","00:43:29,640","She's not done with you."
"936","cue","00:43:29,720","00:43:32,520","Because if she was done with you,
she would've been like cold turkey."
"937","cue","00:43:32,600","00:43:35,240","So in Austen's head, he's like,
""Okay, well, nah."
"938","cue","00:43:35,320","00:43:38,520","They haven't spoke at all.
They broke up when you were in Florida."
"939","cue","00:43:38,600","00:43:42,600","They haven't spoke since, so it's done.""
But realistically, bro, it ain't done"
"940","cue","00:43:42,680","00:43:44,080","because you're still talking
to her parents."
"941","cue","00:43:44,160","00:43:45,720","That's definitely not done."
"942","cue","00:43:45,800","00:43:48,080","It's not put to bed,
so stop pretending it is."
"943","cue","00:43:48,560","00:43:50,960","You're either leading him on
or you're lying to yourself."

"1006","cue","00:46:29,840","00:46:31,920","But even Austen does not need to know,"
"1007","cue","00:46:32,000","00:46:33,320","""We spoke about this,
we spoke about that."""
"1008","cue","00:46:33,400","00:46:35,720","-No, I got the details. I agree.
-That's between Jason and I."
"1009","cue","00:46:35,800","00:46:38,760","But you basically lied to my face,
you've just said to me"
"1010","cue","00:46:38,840","00:46:41,680","-that you haven't spoken.
-Wait, sorry. What?"
"1011","cue","00:46:41,760","00:46:44,800","You lied to my face 'cause you told me
that you and Jason haven't spoken."
"1012","cue","00:46:44,880","00:46:46,640","That is such a fucking lie, Callum."
"1013","cue","00:46:46,720","00:46:48,440","It's on camera. It's on camera."
"1014","cue","00:46:48,520","00:46:51,480","Speaking to Callum is like
you're walking on fucking hot lava."
"1015","cue","00:46:51,560","00:46:54,440","It's like, ""But you said this""--
[stammers]"
"1016","cue","00:46:54,520","00:46:56,040","It's like, ""Shut up, Callum!"""
"1017","cue","00:46:56,120","00:46:59,160","You're the one who's stirring shit
for everyone. I'm fucking sick of it."
"1018","cue","00:46:59,240","00:47:01,320","How am I stirring shit?
I'm looking out for my best mate."
"1019","cue","00:47:01,400","00:47:03,640","I'm not having my mate left in the dark.
It's as simple as that."
"1020","cue","00:47:03,720","00:47:06,240","-He's not left in the dark.
-He's not now 'cause I fucking spoke."
"1021","cue","00:47:06,320","00:47:10,480","Why are you even getting involved, Callum?"
"1022","cue","00:47:10,560","00:47:13,800","You are not in the relationship
with Austen and I."
"1023","cue","00:47:13,880","00:47:17,560","So get yourself out of
the equation because you're not in it."
"1024","cue","00:47:17,640","00:47:19,680","You know what, Callum?
I can't even talk to you."
"1025","cue","00:47:19,760","00:47:21,440","Because you don't know
what you're talking about."
"1026","cue","00:47:22,120","00:47:23,200","All right. Sound."
"1027","cue","00:47:23,280","00:47:25,720","Goodbye. I quit."
"1028","cue","00:47:26,320","00:47:29,760","I think Callum's motto today
when he woke up was,"

"1030","cue","00:47:31,760","00:47:33,800","What did Callum say to you guys?"

-What is real and what is not?"
"1032","cue","00:47:36,280","00:47:38,480","-'Cause I'm getting confused now.
-What Callum said"
"1033","cue","00:47:38,560","00:47:40,920","was when he talked to Claudia,"
"1034","cue","00:47:41,000","00:47:44,920","she said after he got in from Florida,
there was nothing. They didn't talk."
"1035","cue","00:47:45,000","00:47:47,520","There was nothing there.
That's what Claudia said to him."
"1036","cue","00:47:48,280","00:47:50,560","Callum's talked to him,
he said that's not true."
"1037","cue","00:47:50,640","00:47:52,240","They hung out for four days."
"1038","cue","00:47:52,320","00:47:55,080","And she was like, ""I hope what I'm about
to do doesn't change your mind."""

this, ""…doesn't change your mind of me."""

you're still open when I get back."""

-I just think"
"1042","cue","00:48:08,360","00:48:11,160","Austen's coming in here and he's
trying to find a connection with a girl,"
"1043","cue","00:48:11,240","00:48:13,920","and Claudia needs to be honest
and transparent to him."
"1044","cue","00:48:14,000","00:48:15,400","Another thing she told him, she was like,"
"1045","cue","00:48:15,480","00:48:18,720","""I hope you don't look at me in
a bad way when you see me after this."""
"1046","cue","00:48:18,800","00:48:20,160","-She told that to Jason?
-Yeah."
"1047","cue","00:48:20,240","00:48:22,880","If she didn't like him,
why would she fucking care?"
"1048","cue","00:48:22,960","00:48:26,040","It's almost like she's trying to keep
the door open when she comes out."
"1049","cue","00:48:26,120","00:48:27,880","When realistically,
she's told everyone in here,"
"1050","cue","00:48:27,960","00:48:30,000","including me and Austen
that's she's done with him."
"1051","cue","00:48:30,080","00:48:32,200","I ain't having some girl lie to Austen.
And that's it."
"1052","cue","00:48:32,280","00:48:34,000","-You're so full of shit.
-I'm serious."
"1053","cue","00:48:34,080","00:48:35,640","-I don't believe you.
-What do you mean?"
"1054","cue","00:48:35,720","00:48:37,640","I don't believe you're doing this"
"1055","cue","00:48:37,720","00:48:40,160","because you're acting
in Austen's best interests."
"1056","cue","00:48:40,240","00:48:43,080","-Hundred percent.
-I think you're 100% stirring the pot."
"1057","cue","00:48:43,160","00:48:44,400","-I'm not stirring the pot.
-You are."
"1058","cue","00:48:44,480","00:48:46,280","It's truth.
Everything that's happened is truth."
"1059","cue","00:48:46,360","00:48:48,760","I feel so bad for Claudia right now."
"1060","cue","00:48:49,480","00:48:51,600","-[Claudia] I'm so sick of that bloke.
-[Jordan] Yeah, I know."
"1061","cue","00:48:51,680","00:48:53,080","I am so sick of that bloke."
"1062","cue","00:48:53,160","00:48:56,840","He is trying to cause conflict
where there is no conflict."
"1063","cue","00:48:56,920","00:48:58,600","He wants me to tell him
my full life's story."
"1064","cue","00:48:58,680","00:48:59,840","-I know.
-I don't need to tell him"
"1065","cue","00:48:59,920","00:49:01,000","my fucking full life's story."

"1068","cue","00:49:03,960","00:49:07,320","Also, Mitch needs to fucking stop
influencing this fucking shit behavior."
"1069","cue","00:49:08,120","00:49:10,920","Because they're thinking that they're
""doing it for their bro,"" but they're not."
"1070","cue","00:49:11,000","00:49:12,560","His whole thing is,
""I'm doing it for Austen."""
"1071","cue","00:49:12,640","00:49:15,280","It's not me, Austen and Callum.
It's me and fucking Austen."
"1072","cue","00:49:15,360","00:49:16,360","Yeah. Doing what for Austen?"
"1073","cue","00:49:16,440","00:49:18,640","-He's ruined everything.
-He's stirring the pot for Austen."
"1074","cue","00:49:18,720","00:49:20,800","-He ruined everything for you and Austen.
-Thank you."
"1075","cue","00:49:20,880","00:49:23,840","Why do I need to talk about my past?
I broke up with him. I'm here."
"1076","cue","00:49:23,920","00:49:27,680","This is what Mitch was saying. Basically,
what they think is that you've--"
"1077","cue","00:49:27,760","00:49:29,640","You said, to Jason,"
"1078","cue","00:49:29,720","00:49:33,000","""I'm going on <i>Love Island</i>, but
I hope you wait for me when I get out."""

-Are you fucking--"
"1080","cue","00:49:35,000","00:49:36,680","I am so sick of this place."
"1081","cue","00:49:36,760","00:49:38,840","And I said to him--
When he said that, he goes,"

to wait."" And I said--"

"1084","cue","00:49:43,760","00:49:47,160","You said to--
For Jason to wait for you, or whatever."

-Mitch."

I'm so sick of these people."

-No."

-I'm not fucking okay."
"1093","cue","00:50:10,360","00:50:11,640","'Cause you're a fuckwit."

-[Jason] What?"
"1103","cue","00:50:34,600","00:50:37,680","Did I say to you when I left
to wait for me?"

-When I came here."
"1106","cue","00:50:41,760","00:50:43,720","-No.
-So, who said that?"

-I just got told that someone said that."
"1108","cue","00:50:46,880","00:50:48,040","Yeah, Chinese whispers now."
"1109","cue","00:50:48,120","00:50:52,640","No. I got told that Mitch said that,
apparently, I've told Jason, ""Just wait."""

-They said that I told them that?"

"1126","cue","00:51:26,920","00:51:29,240","because Callum's putting his finger
in the pie and he doesn't need to."

a fucking pot stirrer tonight."

Are you gonna tell me who said that?"

at me telling me and accusing me"
"1136","cue","00:51:48,080","00:51:50,080","of saying shit,
because I haven't said anything."
"1137","cue","00:51:50,160","00:51:52,440","-I haven't said anything.
-You're talking so much shit, Callum."
"1138","cue","00:51:52,520","00:51:53,520","Right out your ass."
"1139","cue","00:51:53,600","00:51:55,480","-Sound.
-Just leave it."

-Yes."

-No, Jason."
"1142","cue","00:51:58,600","00:52:00,560","It's not a big deal to where
it has to be a big commotion."
"1143","cue","00:52:00,640","00:52:03,560","It is a big deal 'cause they're trying
to start shit when there's no shit."
"1144","cue","00:52:03,640","00:52:08,160","I think I really got
some miscommunication here with Mitch."
"1145","cue","00:52:08,840","00:52:12,360","When I was on the day bed with Mitch,
Mitch said a comment to me."
"1146","cue","00:52:12,440","00:52:14,120","I didn't say that's what he said."
"1147","cue","00:52:14,760","00:52:17,440","I didn't, Phoebe.
I didn't say he said those words."
"1148","cue","00:52:17,520","00:52:20,400","And, Phoebe, why can't I tell you
that shit? It's between me and you."
"1149","cue","00:52:20,480","00:52:21,480","But she's my friend."
"1150","cue","00:52:21,560","00:52:24,960","It's literally the same as Callum going
to tell people. She's my friend."
"1151","cue","00:52:25,720","00:52:27,760","Claudia is trying to kick off and be mad"
"1152","cue","00:52:27,840","00:52:30,040","but at the end of the day,
she's upset that I've called her out."
"1153","cue","00:52:30,120","00:52:32,400","I might be stupid, but I'm street smart."
"1154","cue","00:52:32,480","00:52:34,520","And I know when shit is fishy."
"1155","cue","00:52:34,600","00:52:36,240","-Twisting words.
-But basically--"
"1156","cue","00:52:36,960","00:52:38,680","Okay. Listen."
"1157","cue","00:52:38,760","00:52:41,600","I know that you guys meant well.
Okay? But it's all done."
"1158","cue","00:52:41,680","00:52:44,400","But the only thing was
that Jason went into more detail."
"1159","cue","00:52:44,480","00:52:46,320","But I don't need to go
into detail with Callum."
"1160","cue","00:52:46,400","00:52:48,080","You should have gone
into detail with Austen."
"1161","cue","00:52:48,160","00:52:51,200","I can do that when I have enough time.
My fucking ex just walked in."
"1162","cue","00:52:51,280","00:52:53,000","I don't need to talk to you about this."
"1163","cue","00:52:53,080","00:52:55,320","I said from day one,
you don't talk to me about it."

to you about anything."

-It's all right."
"1166","cue","00:52:59,200","00:53:03,360","I feel like it's not little things, if
it's things you can get off your chest,"
"1167","cue","00:53:03,440","00:53:06,920","but I think big things like going
to Sydney, spending the night together--"
"1168","cue","00:53:07,000","00:53:09,040","Callum's a copious fuckhead."
"1169","cue","00:53:09,120","00:53:12,080","-I don't think you need to know that.
-No, but I think Austen does."
"1170","cue","00:53:12,160","00:53:14,720","Hold on.
Can I just jump in here just a tad?"
"1171","cue","00:53:14,800","00:53:18,160","Whatever happened before coming
in here should be squashed."
"1172","cue","00:53:18,240","00:53:21,480","Because at the end of the day, Claudia's
for Austen, Austen's for Claudia."
"1173","cue","00:53:21,560","00:53:22,840","That's abundantly clear."
"1174","cue","00:53:22,920","00:53:26,360","I don't think there's any purpose
of digging deep"
"1175","cue","00:53:26,440","00:53:28,640","into stuff that happened
before coming in here."
"1176","cue","00:53:28,720","00:53:31,480","-It's null and void. It's irrelevant.
-That's exactly fucking right."
"1177","cue","00:53:31,560","00:53:35,240","-Why are we digging into--
-Because that's all he can talk about."
"1178","cue","00:53:35,320","00:53:37,760","-Okay, but it's all done.
-[chuckling]"
"1179","cue","00:53:42,240","00:53:44,480","[Claudia] I can't stand him."
"1180","cue","00:53:45,000","00:53:47,040","-I actually can't stand him.
-[Jess] Yeah."

"1183","cue","00:53:56,480","00:53:58,680","<i>Hope tomorrow's episode is calmer.</i>"
"1184","cue","00:53:58,760","00:54:02,960","<i>Unlikely though, 'cause look who's coming.</i>"
"1185","cue","00:54:06,040","00:54:08,120","[person] My name's Mitch. I'm 25.
I'm from Melbourne."
"1186","cue","00:54:08,200","00:54:10,880","And you might remember me as the winner
of last season of <i>Love Island</i>."
"1187","cue","00:54:10,960","00:54:13,240","Sadly, things didn't work out
for me and Tina,"
"1188","cue","00:54:13,320","00:54:15,400","but I'm back for another chance at love."
"1189","cue","00:54:16,200","00:54:20,080","I was a bomb last time. So I would say,
the ultimate bomb is back."
"1190","cue","00:54:20,680","00:54:22,520","The boys, they're gonna be intimidated."
"1191","cue","00:54:22,600","00:54:25,080","But I think the girls
will be pretty happy to see me."
"1192","cue","00:54:26,920","00:54:29,960","If the girl I want is coupled up,
I'm definitely gonna steal her."
"1193","cue","00:54:30,600","00:54:31,720","I'm in there to find the one,"
"1194","cue","00:54:31,800","00:54:34,360","so I don't really care too much
about stepping on toes."
