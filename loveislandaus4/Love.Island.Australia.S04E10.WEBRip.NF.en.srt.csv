"277","cue","00:15:43,240","00:15:46,120","-You had to bend.
-I had to bend down to grab his hand."
"278","cue","00:15:46,200","00:15:48,240","-Because he's short.
-[Maddy] Then I looked left,"
"279","cue","00:15:48,320","00:15:51,840","-and I had to go like that, looked down--

for putting the thought in to this."
"900","cue","00:44:33,480","00:44:35,600","I don't think a guy's
ever really done this for me."
"901","cue","00:44:35,680","00:44:37,240","-Really?
-Never ever."
"902","cue","00:44:37,320","00:44:39,800","No way. I consider myself
to be a bit of a romantic."
"903","cue","00:44:39,880","00:44:43,520","So, I just think that
when you're into someone,"
"904","cue","00:44:43,600","00:44:45,520","that you should give them time and effort."
"905","cue","00:44:46,280","00:44:48,760","-My God. That makes me feel so special.
-Yeah?"
"906","cue","00:44:48,840","00:44:52,320","Yeah. Thank you,
I actually can't believe it."
"907","cue","00:44:52,400","00:44:54,040","-Why?
-No one's done this for me."
"908","cue","00:44:54,120","00:44:58,000","And I didn't think that this would ever be
something that I would get to experience,"

"912","cue","00:45:11,000","00:45:12,680","It's just never been done for me before."
"913","cue","00:45:12,760","00:45:14,960","And I just didn't think
it ever would happen."
"914","cue","00:45:15,040","00:45:17,120","You deserve it.
You're a beautiful girl and…"
"915","cue","00:45:18,080","00:45:20,160","and I think you deserve the world."
"916","cue","00:45:24,200","00:45:28,600","If I am gonna be starting to date
really nice guys that will treat me right,"
"917","cue","00:45:29,320","00:45:31,200","there's gonna be a lot of firsts."

and showing her that I actually do care"
"920","cue","00:45:41,720","00:45:43,040","was really important for me."
