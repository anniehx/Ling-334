"178","cue","00:12:19,760","00:12:22,440","Although we do have our little arguments,"
"179","cue","00:12:22,520","00:12:24,880","I feel like I always find my way
back to him."
"180","cue","00:12:25,560","00:12:29,760","So, the boy I'd like to couple up with is…"
"181","cue","00:12:32,800","00:12:33,640","Conor."
"182","cue","00:12:42,840","00:12:44,720","[exhales sharply] Jesus."
"183","cue","00:12:55,560","00:12:57,560","And then there were two boys."
"184","cue","00:13:00,440","00:13:01,840","And only one girl."
"185","cue","00:13:02,600","00:13:03,840","[sighs]"
"186","cue","00:13:10,560","00:13:11,480","Stella."
"187","cue","00:13:12,920","00:13:14,120","Please stand up."
"188","cue","00:13:16,440","00:13:20,200","Stella, which boy would you like
to couple up with and why?"
"189","cue","00:13:22,960","00:13:24,960","I would like to couple up with this boy"
"190","cue","00:13:25,040","00:13:30,480","because I really enjoyed getting
to know him over the past few days"
"191","cue","00:13:30,560","00:13:32,320","and over our chats."
"192","cue","00:13:33,280","00:13:36,480","I do genuinely believe he's here
for the right reasons."
"193","cue","00:13:40,360","00:13:41,760","You've got this, Stel. You can do it."
"194","cue","00:13:49,400","00:13:51,800","So the boy I'd like to couple up with is…"
"195","cue","00:13:58,200","00:13:59,200","Jordan."
"196","cue","00:14:13,240","00:14:14,600","[Jordan whispering indistinctly]"
"197","cue","00:14:21,960","00:14:23,080","[Stella sniffles]"
"198","cue","00:14:28,200","00:14:31,040","Oh, Stella, darling,
I know that wasn't easy, was it?"
"199","cue","00:14:31,120","00:14:33,680","-[cries, sniffles] But it's okay.
-[Sophie] Yeah."
"200","cue","00:14:35,960","00:14:37,000","I just feel really bad."
"201","cue","00:14:38,360","00:14:39,400","[Sophie] Jordan?"
"202","cue","00:14:40,320","00:14:41,320","Speechless."
"203","cue","00:14:41,400","00:14:44,920","It's been a massive few days
in the villa for me."
"204","cue","00:14:45,000","00:14:48,200","It's been an emotional roller coaster.
So, yeah. Yeah, it's hard."
"205","cue","00:14:48,280","00:14:49,880","Do you wanna say anything to Stella?"
"206","cue","00:14:49,960","00:14:53,560","[smacks lips]
Um, just the few chats we've had--"
"207","cue","00:14:53,640","00:14:57,720","You know,
we're both very soft people deep down."
"208","cue","00:14:57,800","00:15:00,680","But yeah,
I like how strong of a woman she is"
"209","cue","00:15:00,760","00:15:04,240","and how caring and loving personality
she has, for sure."
"210","cue","00:15:05,560","00:15:07,280","That's nice. [sniffles]"
"211","cue","00:15:07,360","00:15:09,560","-Stella, I know it's really hard.
-[Stella chuckles]"
"212","cue","00:15:09,640","00:15:13,640","Obviously, I've been coupled with Andre
for the past few days,"
"213","cue","00:15:13,720","00:15:18,560","so I have had the chance, you know,
to really get to know him and form a bond."
"214","cue","00:15:18,640","00:15:20,200","But yeah, I had to go back on"
"215","cue","00:15:20,280","00:15:23,960","that ""think with your heart,
not with your head"" sort of notion."
"216","cue","00:15:24,040","00:15:28,000","So, yeah, it was a very tough decision."
"217","cue","00:15:32,320","00:15:34,640","Unfortunately, Andre,
you have been left single."
"218","cue","00:15:34,720","00:15:37,520","-That's all right.
-And you have been dumped from the villa."
"219","cue","00:15:37,600","00:15:40,280","Yeah. Stella, it's tough.
But you gotta do what you gotta do."
"220","cue","00:15:40,360","00:15:43,160","-I think we all come here for ourselves.
-[Sophie] Yeah."
"221","cue","00:15:43,240","00:15:46,720","And if that's the right decision for her,
she couldn't have picked a better bloke."
"222","cue","00:15:46,800","00:15:49,440","I'm just extremely grateful
to meet every single one of youse."
"223","cue","00:15:49,520","00:15:51,160","You're all beautiful people."
"224","cue","00:15:51,240","00:15:53,080","Go with your heart
and you'll be all right."
"225","cue","00:15:55,680","00:15:57,360","Andre, you do have 30 minutes"
"226","cue","00:15:57,440","00:15:59,200","-to say goodbye to everyone…
-Yes."
"227","cue","00:15:59,280","00:16:02,200","-…and then it'll be time to leave.
-[Andre] No worries."
"228","cue","00:16:02,280","00:16:06,040","The rest of you, make every moment count."
"229","cue","00:16:06,120","00:16:07,320","I'll see you soon."
"230","cue","00:16:09,480","00:16:11,120","-Enjoy it.
-[Jess] Thanks."
"231","cue","00:16:17,880","00:16:19,160","That's all right, bro."
"232","cue","00:16:19,240","00:16:20,600","[Jordan] We'll see you soon."
"233","cue","00:16:22,000","00:16:23,880","-[Austen] You all right?
-Yeah, bro."
"234","cue","00:16:23,960","00:16:25,160","-I cried.
-Dr. Dre."
"235","cue","00:16:25,240","00:16:27,840","Yeah, I know.
You're gonna make me cry twice."
"236","cue","00:16:28,440","00:16:30,600","[Tak, Andre] One, two, three. Brown boys."
"237","cue","00:16:31,200","00:16:33,920","Yeah, I came here not knowing
what to expect"
"238","cue","00:16:34,000","00:16:36,080","and it's been an emotional roller coaster."
"239","cue","00:16:36,160","00:16:38,600","You know, one day seems like one week,"
"240","cue","00:16:38,680","00:16:41,520","but obviously sad that I'm leaving,
you know, a bit early."
"241","cue","00:16:41,600","00:16:43,680","But that's villa life."
"242","cue","00:16:43,760","00:16:45,960","Coming here was the first time
I packed a suitcase."
"243","cue","00:16:46,040","00:16:49,680","-And just stuff that shit in, bro.
-I normally do, like, flat."
"244","cue","00:16:50,320","00:16:52,320","Bro, first one gone, man. That's fucked."
"245","cue","00:16:52,400","00:16:55,160","[Jordan]
I'm obviously devastated to see Andre go."
"246","cue","00:16:55,240","00:16:58,480","I feel like we've got that bro connection."
"247","cue","00:17:00,480","00:17:04,440","I wanted to tell you that
the reason why I made all that decision…"
"248","cue","00:17:04,520","00:17:05,839","-Mmm.
-…is because"
"249","cue","00:17:06,520","00:17:10,599","when it came down to it,
I knew it would be between you guys"
"250","cue","00:17:10,680","00:17:16,280","and I felt like maybe
because I'd tried with you,"
"251","cue","00:17:16,359","00:17:19,200","-maybe I would try with Jordan…
-Yeah."
"252","cue","00:17:19,280","00:17:21,240","-…and see how that goes.
-Yeah."
"253","cue","00:17:21,319","00:17:25,200","To me, also rationalizing the fact
that I was feeling unsure"
"254","cue","00:17:25,280","00:17:27,040","about Andre this morning,"
"255","cue","00:17:27,119","00:17:30,280","before I even knew
that there was gonna be a recoupling,"
"256","cue","00:17:30,360","00:17:33,720","also just speaks volumes
about my true feelings."
"257","cue","00:17:33,800","00:17:36,480","I really don't mean
any hard feelings towards you."
"258","cue","00:17:36,560","00:17:39,200","-Yeah. That's fine.
-And I'm honestly--"
"259","cue","00:17:39,280","00:17:41,080","-I know I said I'm sorry but--
-I know."
"260","cue","00:17:41,160","00:17:43,920","You gotta do what's best for you.
You shouldn't be saying sorry."
"261","cue","00:17:45,120","00:17:46,480","[Stella] Okay."
"262","cue","00:17:46,560","00:17:50,160","It is a bit disappointing
that I haven't found a genuine connection."
"263","cue","00:17:50,240","00:17:53,240","I think Stella and I tried.
You know, we tried our best."
"264","cue","00:17:53,320","00:17:55,120","If it's not there, it's not there."
"265","cue","00:17:56,560","00:17:57,880","-See you, Dre.
-Yeah, I'll see you."
"266","cue","00:17:57,960","00:17:59,400","[Stella] It was really sad."
"267","cue","00:17:59,480","00:18:00,600","-I'll see you out there.
-Yes."
"268","cue","00:18:00,680","00:18:02,560","I felt like I really let Andre down."
"269","cue","00:18:02,640","00:18:04,040","[Andre] I know, bro."
"270","cue","00:18:04,960","00:18:06,040","See you on the outside."
"271","cue","00:18:06,120","00:18:10,080","Because, you know, all of those
second-guess things run through your head,"
"272","cue","00:18:10,160","00:18:12,920","like, ""I hope I made the right decision."""
"273","cue","00:18:13,000","00:18:15,240","-[Andre] All righty, everyone. Enjoy.
-[Phoebe] All righty."
"274","cue","00:18:15,320","00:18:16,320","-See ya, bro.
-See ya, bro."
"275","cue","00:18:16,400","00:18:17,400","-See ya.
-Bye."
"276","cue","00:18:18,520","00:18:20,440","-Bye, Dre.
-Bye."
"277","cue","00:18:29,480","00:18:32,320","Being the first dumped Islander
is probably not the title you wanna have."
"278","cue","00:18:32,400","00:18:34,280","But that's the way it turned out."
"279","cue","00:18:34,360","00:18:36,360","I didn't find an immediate connection,"
"280","cue","00:18:36,440","00:18:38,520","which is what I have to do
in this environment."
"281","cue","00:18:38,600","00:18:41,120","But Stella and I were coupled up
by default really."
"282","cue","00:18:41,760","00:18:45,640","And I knew that she did fancy Jordan
from the start."
"283","cue","00:19:00,880","00:19:02,240","-[Holly] Stels?
-Yeah?"
"284","cue","00:19:02,320","00:19:03,640","-[Holly] You okay?
-[Stella] Yeah."
"285","cue","00:19:03,720","00:19:07,000","-What's going on?
-Nothing. I'm just trying to stop--"
"286","cue","00:19:07,080","00:19:09,960","I'm just trying to make it look
like I'm not crying."
"287","cue","00:19:10,040","00:19:12,800","It's okay. It's okay if you are crying."
"288","cue","00:19:13,400","00:19:16,400","It's just-- I don't know.
I just feel like-- It's just--"
"289","cue","00:19:16,480","00:19:18,200","-It sucks to do that.
-Yeah."
"290","cue","00:19:18,280","00:19:22,960","It's definitely the right decision
and I'm very glad that I picked Jordan."
"291","cue","00:19:23,040","00:19:26,480","Just a sucky one to execute."
"292","cue","00:19:26,560","00:19:27,840","It's hard for you…"
"293","cue","00:19:27,920","00:19:29,720","-Yeah.
-…having to make that decision."
"294","cue","00:19:29,800","00:19:33,960","And I think after a sleep, I'm going
to wake up and be like, ""New day!"""
"295","cue","00:19:34,040","00:19:35,200","You've been sleeping pretty good."
"296","cue","00:19:35,280","00:19:36,920","So hopefully you bring that
into the bedroom,"
"297","cue","00:19:37,000","00:19:38,680","-and I can have some good sleeps too.
-Yeah."
"298","cue","00:19:38,760","00:19:41,280","So hopefully tonight
I'll sleep even better"
"299","cue","00:19:41,360","00:19:43,280","and then that will bring more good juju."
"300","cue","00:19:43,360","00:19:44,360","-Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah."
"301","cue","00:19:45,120","00:19:49,080","Juju is a word in another thing
that means like good luck, yeah?"
"302","cue","00:19:51,040","00:19:52,840","-Yeah.
-Is it Buddhism? Juju?"
"303","cue","00:19:52,920","00:19:55,640","I don't know exactly what it--
where it's from."
"304","cue","00:19:57,520","00:20:00,000","You do have very beautiful blue eyes,
by the way."
"305","cue","00:20:01,160","00:20:04,280","-Aw!
-I know. Keen. [chuckles]"
"306","cue","00:20:07,520","00:20:09,520","[Holly] Yeah. I thought it was very nice."
"307","cue","00:20:09,600","00:20:12,080","-It made me feel like-- Yeah, happy.
-Yeah."
"308","cue","00:20:12,160","00:20:14,200","And I think we've got a cool vibe too."
"309","cue","00:20:14,280","00:20:16,880","And I'm so happy to continue
to get to know you."
"310","cue","00:20:16,960","00:20:19,000","-And just-- Yeah.
-See what happens."
"311","cue","00:20:19,080","00:20:21,560","Finally, someone's picked Holly."
"312","cue","00:20:21,640","00:20:23,840","So like-- What the fuck was that?"
"313","cue","00:20:23,920","00:20:26,000","-That was a moth.
-Another?"
"314","cue","00:20:26,080","00:20:28,200","-[laughing]
-[imitates gagging]"
"315","cue","00:20:29,760","00:20:31,760","Oh, it's coming at me. Oh, no. Fuck."
"316","cue","00:20:31,840","00:20:36,280","-[gasps] No. Oh, my God. We need to go.
-No, its coming. No, fuck that. No."
"317","cue","00:20:36,360","00:20:38,320","-Oh, my God, I can't.
-No."
"318","cue","00:20:38,400","00:20:39,840","[Jess] To you and you and you."
"319","cue","00:20:40,360","00:20:43,400","-Can I just start by saying…
-[Jess] Yeah."
"320","cue","00:20:43,480","00:20:46,640","…I wanted to get this out of the bag
'cause I can't hold it in anymore."
"321","cue","00:20:46,720","00:20:47,600","Yeah, go."
"322","cue","00:20:47,680","00:20:50,400","But every time that bloke touches me,
I mean my bloke…"
"323","cue","00:20:50,480","00:20:51,480","[Jess] Yeah?"
"324","cue","00:20:52,600","00:20:55,400","-It's like-- Yeah. Everything.
-Fanny?"
"325","cue","00:20:55,480","00:20:58,480","-[gasps] Shut up.
-Yeah. I can't deal with it."
"326","cue","00:20:59,440","00:21:01,040","[laughs] I am so happy."
"327","cue","00:21:01,120","00:21:06,800","I am so happy
that I am finally in a couple with Austen."
"328","cue","00:21:06,880","00:21:09,040","I feel like it's literally
about damn time."
"329","cue","00:21:09,640","00:21:11,920","-He's good-looking.
-He's so good-looking."
"330","cue","00:21:12,000","00:21:14,800","But for you… Conor.
Listen, this is what I think."
"331","cue","00:21:14,880","00:21:16,760","-I think he's loyal.
-I have to-- Yeah."
"332","cue","00:21:16,840","00:21:17,840","I have to give him props"
"333","cue","00:21:17,920","00:21:20,040","because Conor has been
through a load of stuff with you."
"334","cue","00:21:20,120","00:21:22,920","-You've been talking to a lot of boys.
-And he had to watch."
"335","cue","00:21:23,000","00:21:26,880","And he has still always said
you are his first pick."
"336","cue","00:21:26,960","00:21:30,480","-He just waited for me.
-And Callum-- Yeah, that's great."
"337","cue","00:21:30,560","00:21:32,080","Are you still gonna get to know him?"
"338","cue","00:21:32,160","00:21:34,680","[Jess] After what he said in his speech"
"339","cue","00:21:34,760","00:21:38,200","that when other girls talk,
it goes in one ear and out the other,"
"340","cue","00:21:38,280","00:21:39,920","I was like…"
"341","cue","00:21:40,000","00:21:44,760","I was pretty blindsided
about Callum's decision in the fire pit."
"342","cue","00:21:44,840","00:21:47,120","I thought he was gonna choose me."
"343","cue","00:21:47,200","00:21:48,720","And then he chose Layla."
"344","cue","00:21:48,800","00:21:51,320","But, honestly,
I think it was a blessing in disguise."
"345","cue","00:21:51,400","00:21:54,520","Because, out of everyone,
his head would be the first to turn."

"514","cue","00:29:51,720","00:29:53,240","So I've got the black kicks on."
"515","cue","00:29:53,320","00:29:54,920","I've gone for the green shorts."
"516","cue","00:29:55,000","00:29:57,680","I've just matched the kicks with
the top, so I think I'm looking fresh."
"517","cue","00:29:57,760","00:29:58,760","-That's sick.
-Is it?"
"518","cue","00:29:58,840","00:30:00,160","-Yeah.

I think it still looks good like this."

-We're off."
"523","cue","00:30:10,080","00:30:12,080","-[Austen] Let's go.
-See you, guys."
"524","cue","00:30:12,920","00:30:14,360","-It's gonna be okay.
-Is it though?"
"525","cue","00:30:14,440","00:30:16,920","Yes, it's gonna be fine. I promise."
"526","cue","00:30:17,640","00:30:19,680","-Bye.
-Have fun, boys."
"527","cue","00:30:19,760","00:30:21,880","-Good luck.
-Have fun. Not too much."
"528","cue","00:30:21,960","00:30:24,560","-Get your graft on.
-Not too much."
"529","cue","00:30:24,640","00:30:27,880","I feel like even though it's early days
with us, it's like still good."
"530","cue","00:30:27,960","00:30:32,680","So hopefully he doesn't
turn his head too far."

-Open mind."
"534","cue","00:30:41,960","00:30:43,920","-Open mind, but at the same time--
-At the same time,"
"535","cue","00:30:44,000","00:30:46,040","I'm gonna have Claudia
in the back of my mind, for sure."
"536","cue","00:30:46,120","00:30:47,760","-[Callum] 100%
-[Austen] No, for sure."
"537","cue","00:30:48,680","00:30:52,000","-We're fine. Everything is fine.
-Claudia has nothing to worry about."
"538","cue","00:30:52,080","00:30:53,720","But then again, I don't want
to speak to the sky."
"539","cue","00:31:07,200","00:31:08,320","This looks nice too."
"540","cue","00:31:09,000","00:31:11,480","-You reckon she's brunette?
-I reckon she's brunette."
"541","cue","00:31:11,560","00:31:13,080","-I'm gonna go with blonde.
-Are you?"
"542","cue","00:31:13,160","00:31:14,680","I think she's gonna be brunette, 100%."
"543","cue","00:31:14,760","00:31:16,320","[Austen]
She would have to have a cracker body."
"544","cue","00:31:16,400","00:31:17,400","[Callum] I reckon."
"545","cue","00:31:19,000","00:31:21,120","-Here she is. That's gotta be her.
-For sure."
"546","cue","00:31:26,200","00:31:27,760","I'm Maddy. I'm 26 years old."
"547","cue","00:31:27,840","00:31:29,880","I'm from Perth and I'm an HR adviser."
"548","cue","00:31:32,240","00:31:34,560","I would describe myself as very flirty."
"549","cue","00:31:36,720","00:31:39,240","I'll definitely be in competition
with a few of the girls,"
"550","cue","00:31:39,320","00:31:41,680","but I'll show the OG's how it's done."
"551","cue","00:31:43,960","00:31:48,320","I was a very rebellious teenager,
ended up getting expelled from school."
"552","cue","00:31:48,400","00:31:50,400","I called the principal a… My bad."
"553","cue","00:31:52,160","00:31:54,760","I mean, she was one, so it was justified."
"554","cue","00:31:56,160","00:31:58,120","I know what I want,
especially when it comes to men."
"555","cue","00:32:01,320","00:32:04,760","I like a lot of masculine energy,
I like them to have a lot of confidence."
"556","cue","00:32:05,440","00:32:07,560","Unfortunately, sometimes
that comes with a lot of ego,"
"557","cue","00:32:07,640","00:32:09,560","which bites me in the arse
a bit later down the line."
"558","cue","00:32:12,680","00:32:15,000","For me, the guy needs to be
at least 6'3"" and above."
"559","cue","00:32:15,080","00:32:17,080","I mean, I'm 5'10"". I like them big."

What do you look for in a girl?"

we'll have to see about that."
