backhanded comments like that,"

-Huh. Like, no words?"

I met her in this environment."

But we won, like, the show--"

we haven't spoke in a while."

"269","cue","00:12:41,160","00:12:44,600","I'm interested to just pick her brain
a little bit and see how things are."

she seems like she's in a good headspace."

with everything that's happened,"
"272","cue","00:12:49,160","00:12:52,440","that she's moved on and things like that,
which is good for her."

Mitch was just sitting there like-- like--"

-I don't know that he's all sweet."
"277","cue","00:13:04,640","00:13:07,960","{\an8}I don't think he's upset. I think he's
more upset that-- it's not all about him."

what's there to be upset about?"

-[Mitchell] He was like-- Yeah."

"283","cue","00:13:15,760","00:13:20,520","When Mitch and I stopped talking,
I wouldn't say we weren't friends anymore,"

I think our friendship is, like, small."

In forever."

to see his missus come in,"

to see a guy like me tuning his bird."

Like, even though he's in here,"
"292","cue","00:13:41,720","00:13:43,560","like, I still didn't come here
to talk about my ex."
"293","cue","00:13:43,640","00:13:46,840","It's kind of annoying that he's here.
'Cause I don't think of him like that now."
"294","cue","00:13:48,000","00:13:49,760","-Surely not. Like--
-[Mitchell] Wait."
"295","cue","00:13:49,840","00:13:52,080","We've already spoken.
Don't speak to me now."
"296","cue","00:13:52,160","00:13:53,640","Oh, she's talking to them first."
"297","cue","00:13:53,720","00:13:56,000","I'll just go and grab her.
I don't really care."

"302","cue","00:14:04,240","00:14:06,120","I feel like
he'll definitely want to talk to you."
"303","cue","00:14:06,200","00:14:09,400","-Yeah. I'll happily speak to him.
-Yeah, have a chat with him."
"304","cue","00:14:09,480","00:14:11,720","But I'm like,
we need to go speak to someone else."

"306","cue","00:14:15,480","00:14:18,880","Same.
Us watching it all with, like, popcorn."
"307","cue","00:14:18,960","00:14:20,720","It feels like
I'm watching it on TV right now."
"308","cue","00:14:20,800","00:14:21,920","Me too, but I'm like, ""Hey."""
"309","cue","00:14:22,000","00:14:23,440","-It's like-- We're, like, 5D.
-Inside the TV."

-We're like 5D."

-That's what I was thinking."
"325","cue","00:15:03,480","00:15:06,120","-I'm still a little bit rattled, but--
-[Tina] I know you're rattled,"
"326","cue","00:15:06,200","00:15:08,320","I can see it on your-- your face, mate."
"327","cue","00:15:12,360","00:15:15,080","-Oh, my God, she is so shy.
-Huh?"
"328","cue","00:15:19,480","00:15:23,280","I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
or anything."
"329","cue","00:15:23,360","00:15:25,160","-No.
-I'm the one sleeping on the couch,"
"330","cue","00:15:25,240","00:15:27,400","-so I'm pretty--
-You can sleep in the bed, it's fine."
"331","cue","00:15:27,480","00:15:29,880","Maybe sleep on the daybed
for old times' sake?"
"332","cue","00:15:29,960","00:15:31,520","-Fuck off.
-[laughs]"
"333","cue","00:15:31,600","00:15:33,120","-You're so annoying.
-What?"
"334","cue","00:15:33,200","00:15:36,480","-The book's closed.
-I'm joking."
"335","cue","00:15:36,560","00:15:37,560","I know."
"336","cue","00:15:38,560","00:15:40,120","I'm not, though."
"337","cue","00:15:40,200","00:15:42,600","I think the fact
that Tina's being sassy with me,"
"338","cue","00:15:42,680","00:15:44,240","I'm making a few little digs…"
"339","cue","00:15:44,320","00:15:45,920","No, I'm just taking the piss."
"340","cue","00:15:46,000","00:15:48,880","I think she's trying to hide
a few feelings and things like that"
"341","cue","00:15:48,960","00:15:50,360","that she may be feeling."
"342","cue","00:15:50,440","00:15:52,600","Well, the biggest thing, I said it before,"
"343","cue","00:15:52,680","00:15:56,240","is it's like a setting where, like, we met
and then we've done all this,"
"344","cue","00:15:56,320","00:15:59,240","-and I've been here for a few days--
-Aw. You're getting sentimental."
"345","cue","00:15:59,320","00:16:01,200","[both laugh]"
"346","cue","00:16:01,280","00:16:02,320","No. You know what I mean."
"347","cue","00:16:02,400","00:16:05,040","I feel like you'll feel that as well,
at some point."
"348","cue","00:16:05,120","00:16:06,200","I was kind of like, ""Fuck."""
"349","cue","00:16:06,280","00:16:08,080","-I don't know. It brings it all back.
-Yeah."
"350","cue","00:16:08,160","00:16:13,200","I look back at Mitch and my time
in the villa last time around so fondly."
"351","cue","00:16:13,280","00:16:18,040","And if I was to reminisce on our time,
I would feel the exact same way."
"352","cue","00:16:18,120","00:16:21,440","I'm just, like, not trying to
think of those things"
"353","cue","00:16:21,520","00:16:26,960","'cause I don't really think it's helpful
to moving on and finding someone else."
"354","cue","00:16:27,040","00:16:30,240","Even if you weren't here,
I'm sure I would reference stuff"
"355","cue","00:16:30,320","00:16:31,600","and have a memory of it."
"356","cue","00:16:31,680","00:16:35,040","I just feel you've kind of, like,
for lack of a better term,"
"357","cue","00:16:35,120","00:16:37,640","shat on everything so hard
that I don't really--"
"358","cue","00:16:37,720","00:16:39,720","Oh, I've shat on everything so hard?"
"359","cue","00:16:39,800","00:16:41,280","-Yeah.
-In what way?"
"360","cue","00:16:41,360","00:16:43,600","Oh. [chuckles]"
"361","cue","00:16:43,680","00:16:45,480","Shat on everything so hard in what way?"
"362","cue","00:16:45,560","00:16:48,400","What I'm just saying is, like,
just to me it's so dead"
"363","cue","00:16:48,480","00:16:50,640","that I don't know if I can-- [stammers]"
"364","cue","00:16:50,720","00:16:53,840","You're saying
you can't feel things come back?"
"365","cue","00:16:53,920","00:16:56,640","I don't know.
I don't know if I'll let them."
"366","cue","00:16:57,440","00:16:59,200","-[Mitch] Yeah.
-Is what I'm saying."
"367","cue","00:16:59,280","00:17:02,320","I feel like
he had kind of ruined anything."
"368","cue","00:17:02,400","00:17:03,280","Like, it doesn't--"
"369","cue","00:17:03,360","00:17:07,200","I don't feel like there's anything
unfinished with Mitch, because for me,"
"370","cue","00:17:07,280","00:17:11,280","I felt like there was too much hurt
and back and forth"
"371","cue","00:17:11,359","00:17:13,839","for there to be anything to recover from."
"372","cue","00:17:13,920","00:17:15,400","Okay, let's go back up,"
"373","cue","00:17:15,480","00:17:19,280","because I need to talk to other people
that aren't you. [chuckles]"
"374","cue","00:17:20,160","00:17:23,440","Yeah, I don't really know what,
if I'm honest, my plan of attack is now."
"375","cue","00:17:23,520","00:17:25,000","I've lost my head a little bit."
"376","cue","00:17:25,079","00:17:26,560","-You enjoy your chats.
-[Tina] Huh?"
"377","cue","00:17:26,640","00:17:30,640","We've gotta walk the same way,
so why you saying, like, ""Bye""?"
"378","cue","00:17:30,720","00:17:32,200","Are you gonna stand by this pot plant?"
"379","cue","00:17:32,280","00:17:34,040","-[Mitch] Yeah, and watch.
-[Tina groans]"
"380","cue","00:17:34,120","00:17:36,120","[Mitch] The last few days being sort of--"
"381","cue","00:17:36,200","00:17:40,000","You know, getting to know everyone
and having a bit of fun has been great,"
"382","cue","00:17:40,080","00:17:42,800","but, yeah, right now,
my mood's changed completely."
"383","cue","00:17:42,880","00:17:45,160","-There's a lot right in the corner.
-[sighs]"
"384","cue","00:17:45,240","00:17:47,640","I don't like
pulling people away from people."
"385","cue","00:17:47,720","00:17:49,760","-Uh-huh?
-[Tina chuckles]"
"386","cue","00:17:49,840","00:17:50,840","Bye."
"387","cue","00:17:53,960","00:17:55,120","[Mitch] See you."
"388","cue","00:17:56,080","00:17:59,120","Yeah, it's all just coming back
a little bit and just hitting me, um…"
"389","cue","00:17:59,200","00:18:00,880","Yeah, I'm not really su-- Fuck."
"390","cue","00:18:00,960","00:18:03,680","Yeah, it's all just coming back,
to be honest. And that side,"
"391","cue","00:18:03,760","00:18:07,480","the part that's a little bit emotional,
it's hit me a bit. [sniffs]"
"392","cue","00:18:07,560","00:18:09,640","[melancholy music playing]"
"393","cue","00:18:16,600","00:18:21,280","Yeah. For me, seeing her just brings
back memories, to be honest, um-- Yeah."
"394","cue","00:18:23,600","00:18:25,080","I'm just fucking rattled."
"395","cue","00:18:31,360","00:18:32,360","[sniffs]"
"396","cue","00:18:34,200","00:18:35,360","[exhales deeply]"
"397","cue","00:18:47,480","00:18:50,320","-Oh.
-I'm originally a Victorian country boy."
"398","cue","00:18:50,400","00:18:51,840","-Oh, right.
-So, I'm not, like--"
"399","cue","00:18:51,920","00:18:53,880","-Whereabouts?
-Do you know Gippsland?"
"400","cue","00:18:53,960","00:18:55,400","-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Yeah."
"401","cue","00:18:56,720","00:18:58,600","[melancholy music playing]"
"402","cue","00:19:01,600","00:19:03,080","That's the girl that, you know,"
"403","cue","00:19:03,160","00:19:06,080","was probably the first time
I'd ever let someone in,"
"404","cue","00:19:06,160","00:19:08,840","let my walls down and cared about someone,
and, yeah."
"405","cue","00:19:09,880","00:19:10,880","[clicks tongue]"
"406","cue","00:19:11,920","00:19:15,120","Just to see them again,
it's just like-- Yeah."
"407","cue","00:19:18,680","00:19:19,680","[sniffs, sighs]"
"408","cue","00:19:26,640","00:19:28,520","Fuck, lost me head."
"409","cue","00:19:46,640","00:19:48,080","[narrator] <i>After a tough breakup,</i>"
"410","cue","00:19:48,160","00:19:51,280","<i>it's important to get back</i>
<i>into the dating game.</i>"
"411","cue","00:19:51,360","00:19:55,040","<i>Preferably not the same dating show,</i>
<i>but Tina and Mitch carry on.</i>"
"412","cue","00:19:55,120","00:20:00,000","<i>And excitingly, Mitch is getting pulled</i>
<i>for a chat by a total hottie.</i>"
"413","cue","00:20:00,080","00:20:01,960","-Do you wanna chat?
-Yeah, let's roll."
"414","cue","00:20:02,040","00:20:03,280","Uh, good chat, girls."
"415","cue","00:20:03,920","00:20:06,000","You'll be all right. We're here for you."
"416","cue","00:20:06,080","00:20:10,200","This Mitch is a totally different Mitch
from a few hours ago."
"417","cue","00:20:10,280","00:20:12,600","The Mitch a few hours ago
was jumping up with excitement,"
"418","cue","00:20:12,680","00:20:15,280","pumping the boys up,
talking to girls, grafting."
"419","cue","00:20:15,360","00:20:16,800","How did your chat go with her?"
"420","cue","00:20:16,880","00:20:18,200","[Mitch] I don't know."
"421","cue","00:20:18,280","00:20:20,960","-She just had so many backhanded--
-Down there?"
"422","cue","00:20:21,040","00:20:22,640","Yeah, as well, and I'm just like--"
"423","cue","00:20:22,720","00:20:23,840","-Really?
-Yeah."
"424","cue","00:20:23,920","00:20:25,360","-Was she--
-That's how she is, though."
"425","cue","00:20:25,440","00:20:28,120","It's her personality.
She'll be, like, firing stuff."
"426","cue","00:20:28,200","00:20:31,200","So, what did she say?
She's, like, not dirty or anything, or…"
"427","cue","00:20:31,280","00:20:32,400","No, not really."
"428","cue","00:20:32,480","00:20:35,120","She said I'd been shitting on everything
or something. I was like,"
"429","cue","00:20:35,200","00:20:37,240","-""How did I shit on everything?""
-Why did she bring that up?"
"430","cue","00:20:37,320","00:20:39,880","I think she's just talking about
the Emily stuff, bro."
"431","cue","00:20:39,960","00:20:41,280","No, bro. I'm not really sure."
"432","cue","00:20:41,920","00:20:44,120","[Al] I don't know the full story
on what the heck happened,"
"433","cue","00:20:44,200","00:20:46,600","I just knew that they broke up,
and then a week later,"
"434","cue","00:20:46,680","00:20:50,600","he ended up sleeping with Emily
from his season."
"435","cue","00:20:50,680","00:20:53,920","And that's when I believe
that things turned sour"
"436","cue","00:20:54,000","00:20:56,480","between, um, Mitch and Tina."
"437","cue","00:20:56,560","00:21:00,880","I know it's a pretty tough question,
but do you still have feelings for her?"
"438","cue","00:21:01,880","00:21:04,880","[blows]
Do I still have feelings for her? Fuck."
"439","cue","00:21:05,920","00:21:08,880","I don't know. I feel like you can't go
through an experience like this"
"440","cue","00:21:08,960","00:21:11,560","and share such a special bond
that we'll always have"
"441","cue","00:21:11,640","00:21:14,040","and then just be nothing
when you see each other."
"442","cue","00:21:14,120","00:21:16,000","-I feel like that's--
-Yeah."
"443","cue","00:21:16,080","00:21:17,280","In my head right now,"
"444","cue","00:21:17,360","00:21:20,120","it wouldn't really make sense
to go back there,"
"445","cue","00:21:20,200","00:21:23,320","but obviously I don't feel nothing,
you know what I mean?"
"446","cue","00:21:23,400","00:21:26,040","Seeing her again and then seeing her
talk to blokes and stuff like that,"
"447","cue","00:21:26,120","00:21:28,320","-it's not the nicest feeling, you know?
-Yeah."
"448","cue","00:21:28,400","00:21:30,320","-Do you wanna go for a chat?
-Yeah, all right."
"449","cue","00:21:30,400","00:21:32,920","-[Jordan] I'll swap spots, Al.
-We'll swap spots."
"450","cue","00:21:33,000","00:21:35,280","Although this looks quite romantic,
you guys."
"451","cue","00:21:35,360","00:21:36,840","It looks like
you're having an intimate chat."
"452","cue","00:21:36,920","00:21:39,440","-We might hook up.
-[chuckles]"
"453","cue","00:21:39,520","00:21:41,480","-Where do you wanna go?
-Um."
"454","cue","00:21:41,560","00:21:44,200","-Let's go down this way.
-Further away. [chuckles]"
"455","cue","00:21:44,720","00:21:46,760","-It's a fucking rough day, hey.
-[Jordan] Yeah."
"456","cue","00:21:46,840","00:21:48,160","-You're so tan.
-I've been--"
"457","cue","00:21:48,240","00:21:50,720","[Mitch] Good on her, getting her graft on.
It's only fair,"
"458","cue","00:21:50,800","00:21:53,840","I've actually grafted the house down
the last two days."
"459","cue","00:21:54,560","00:21:56,040","-But how's things? What's been happening?
-Ah."
"460","cue","00:21:56,120","00:21:58,000","I don't know, it's been like a whirlwind."
"461","cue","00:21:58,080","00:21:59,960","-[Al] Yeah.
-It's like coming into here,"
"462","cue","00:22:00,040","00:22:01,640","like, I just didn't even know."
"463","cue","00:22:01,720","00:22:04,200","Did it take a long time for you
to decide to come in, or…"
"464","cue","00:22:04,280","00:22:08,200","No. I loved it the first time.
Like, I knew that I would love it."
"465","cue","00:22:08,280","00:22:09,880","So, you knew straightaway,
""I wanna do it""?"
"466","cue","00:22:09,960","00:22:12,560","Yeah. I'm not someone
that says no to something."
"467","cue","00:22:12,640","00:22:17,680","So I feel like my game plan
is just try to talk to everyone."
"468","cue","00:22:17,760","00:22:20,200","You gotta not be afraid to just go for it."
"469","cue","00:22:20,280","00:22:22,720","I know. I'm doing my best,"
"470","cue","00:22:22,800","00:22:26,760","but I think tonight,
I'm just gonna dip my toes into everyone."
"471","cue","00:22:26,840","00:22:30,160","-Yeah. Sounds a bit sexual. [chuckles]
-That doesn't sound right."
"472","cue","00:22:30,240","00:22:33,280","I don't think anyone wants my toes
dipped into them."
"473","cue","00:22:33,360","00:22:34,880","I think at this point,"
"474","cue","00:22:34,960","00:22:39,560","I can't really think of the other girls
before myself. So it's hard,"
"475","cue","00:22:39,640","00:22:43,240","because obviously it's all so fresh
for me, talking to these guys."
"476","cue","00:22:43,320","00:22:45,040","Do you wanna go for a chat?"
"477","cue","00:22:45,120","00:22:47,960","-Yeah, sure thing. Where are we going?
-[Tina] Let's go. I don't know."
"478","cue","00:22:48,040","00:22:50,520","I feel like I need to go somewhere
I've not been before."
"479","cue","00:22:50,600","00:22:53,160","-Your nipple's out. [chuckles]
-[Tak] Yeah, his nipple's always out."
"480","cue","00:22:53,240","00:22:56,360","Like, I'm still trying to
get my lay of the land."
"481","cue","00:22:56,440","00:22:59,400","What's your ideal--
Like, what are you looking for?"
"482","cue","00:22:59,480","00:23:00,680","Just someone who makes me laugh."
"483","cue","00:23:00,760","00:23:04,320","Someone who's funny.
Someone who, you know, is engaging,"
"484","cue","00:23:04,400","00:23:06,720","'cause a lot of these girls,
you have a conversation with them"
"485","cue","00:23:06,800","00:23:08,400","-and you're like-- Yeah.
-These ones?"
"486","cue","00:23:08,480","00:23:10,400","[Phoebe H] She's coming in hot."
"487","cue","00:23:10,480","00:23:12,680","-[Tina] I won't tell.
-Yeah. But I'm always honest."
"488","cue","00:23:12,760","00:23:15,640","I think you've gotta be.
I don't know. I can't fake something,"
"489","cue","00:23:15,720","00:23:17,360","like, if it's not there,
then it's just, like,"

-[Tak] Yeah, for sure. Yeah."
"727","cue","00:34:21,880","00:34:24,960","And closer as friends,
