new things about himself"

and I will fuck you up so fucking hard."
"131","cue","00:06:53,160","00:06:56,240","Just out of the doghouse.
I'm still on the leash."
"132","cue","00:06:56,320","00:06:59,560","I'm tied up, but I'm allowed around
to play on the lawn."

that this is me giving in"

"172","cue","00:09:04,200","00:09:07,120","-I gotta leave that one between you two.
-Okay."
"173","cue","00:09:07,200","00:09:09,320","-[Tak] I want you guys to--
-He'll tell me?"
"174","cue","00:09:09,400","00:09:12,400","Yeah, it's a you-two thing."
"175","cue","00:09:12,480","00:09:15,880","He certainly has been giving me
less attention."
"176","cue","00:09:15,960","00:09:19,240","And he wasn't even giving me
that much attention in the first place."
"177","cue","00:09:19,960","00:09:22,440","Do you want to progress
or do you feel like it's stagnant?"
"178","cue","00:09:22,520","00:09:25,440","I want to progress
and I'm trying to push for that."
"179","cue","00:09:25,520","00:09:27,200","But I feel like he's holding back."
"180","cue","00:09:27,280","00:09:29,960","-Well, you won't know until you ask him.
-Yeah, exactly."
"181","cue","00:09:30,040","00:09:33,960","I know. I can't speak to him right now.
I want to go out there but I just can't."
"182","cue","00:09:34,040","00:09:35,720","Yeah, he's a bit busy."
"183","cue","00:09:35,800","00:09:36,840","I know he's with Phoebe."
"184","cue","00:09:36,920","00:09:38,160","-Yeah.
-Right now?"
"185","cue","00:09:38,240","00:09:39,880","-Yeah.
-Right now."
"186","cue","00:09:39,960","00:09:43,280","It makes me sad
because obviously I just catch the vibes."
"187","cue","00:09:43,360","00:09:46,400","I get it.
Like, they're talking and stuff like that"
"188","cue","00:09:46,480","00:09:49,200","and she gave him that big kiss
in the challenge."
"189","cue","00:09:49,280","00:09:53,520","So obviously she's interested in him,
but I just don't want to lose him."
"190","cue","00:09:53,600","00:09:55,160","-Don't stress.
-[Maddy] Oh, Stel."
"191","cue","00:09:55,240","00:09:58,040","[Tak] Don't stress. No need to stress."
"192","cue","00:10:07,240","00:10:10,240","Would you like to go for a chat?"
"193","cue","00:10:11,320","00:10:13,120","-Where do you want to go?
-I don't know."
"194","cue","00:10:13,200","00:10:14,440","We can go up in the nook."
"195","cue","00:10:14,520","00:10:15,600","Vakoo's very playful."
"196","cue","00:10:15,680","00:10:19,440","She's got personality. She's got chat.
She's stunning."
"197","cue","00:10:19,520","00:10:21,760","Vakoo could be number one,
you know, she could--"
"198","cue","00:10:21,840","00:10:23,640","she-- she could meet Mums one day."
"199","cue","00:10:23,720","00:10:25,680","[narrator] <i>Could this be the beginning of</i>"

"204","cue","00:10:38,600","00:10:41,520","I don't think we've had
a proper conversation."
"205","cue","00:10:41,600","00:10:42,760","What's on your mind?"
"206","cue","00:10:42,840","00:10:44,200","I want to know more about you."
"207","cue","00:10:44,280","00:10:47,240","I love horror movies.
I like to just feel things, you know?"
"208","cue","00:10:47,320","00:10:49,240","-But do you get scared easily?
-Yeah."
"209","cue","00:10:49,320","00:10:53,720","-Do you believe in, like-- If you died…
-If I died, yes? Straight up."
"210","cue","00:10:53,800","00:10:57,880","…do you-- would you want to be buried
or do you want to be, um, cremated?"
"211","cue","00:10:58,960","00:11:00,360","Think I'd be cremated."
"212","cue","00:11:00,440","00:11:02,600","Yeah. I love cremation, yeah?"
"213","cue","00:11:02,680","00:11:04,040","-I have this theory.
-Why's that?"
"214","cue","00:11:04,120","00:11:06,120","-I wanna get cremated, yeah?
-Yeah."
"215","cue","00:11:06,200","00:11:09,400","And hopefully I'm married
by that stage when I die, you know?"
"216","cue","00:11:09,480","00:11:10,880","And my husband is still alive,"
"217","cue","00:11:11,760","00:11:14,960","-and my husband will have my ashes, yeah?
-Mmm."
"218","cue","00:11:15,040","00:11:17,560","But then every morning
when he makes a smoothie,"
"219","cue","00:11:17,640","00:11:20,440","I want him to put
a little teaspoon of my ashes."
"220","cue","00:11:20,520","00:11:25,400","So then he drinks me and then
I'm with him for the rest of our lives."
"221","cue","00:11:26,960","00:11:28,680","That's some Voodoo type of shit."
"222","cue","00:11:28,760","00:11:31,560","-[laughs] What? Is that not romantic?
-That's freaky."
"223","cue","00:11:31,640","00:11:34,040","-I mean, yeah. It is.
-Would you do that?"
"224","cue","00:11:34,120","00:11:35,840","-Would you drink my ashes?
-I'd drink your ashes."
"225","cue","00:11:35,920","00:11:37,200","-Would you actually?
-Yeah."
"226","cue","00:11:37,280","00:11:39,360","-No but-- Would you actually?
-Yes."
"227","cue","00:11:40,480","00:11:42,640","I do not want to drink Vakoo's ashes."
"228","cue","00:11:43,680","00:11:45,520","That's kind of weird. Um…"
"229","cue","00:11:45,600","00:11:48,280","But at the same time
how would she know, I'd be dead?"
"230","cue","00:11:50,280","00:11:52,000","Oh, she'd be dead. Not me."
"231","cue","00:11:52,080","00:11:54,560","Were you sad you didn't get
to kiss me in the challenge?"
"232","cue","00:11:54,640","00:11:55,960","-A little bit.
-Yeah."
"233","cue","00:11:56,040","00:11:57,760","Yeah. I was kind of hoping."
"234","cue","00:11:57,840","00:12:00,720","Yeah. Is that the only place
you could have kissed me?"
"235","cue","00:12:00,800","00:12:02,840","-Definitely not.
-[laughs]"
"236","cue","00:12:03,600","00:12:04,840","-What?
-I don't know."
"237","cue","00:12:04,920","00:12:06,800","-Why are you nervous?
-I'm not nervous."
"238","cue","00:12:06,880","00:12:09,280","-Mm-hmm.
-I never get nervous. I'm chill."
"239","cue","00:12:09,360","00:12:11,320","Yeah, I've been wanting
to kiss you for ages."
"240","cue","00:12:11,400","00:12:12,480","-Is that so?
-Yeah."
"241","cue","00:12:12,560","00:12:14,200","-Are you just saying that?
-Yeah."
"242","cue","00:12:14,280","00:12:17,320","But since we've been talking,
I decided that I wanted to kiss you."
"243","cue","00:12:31,920","00:12:32,920","[chuckles]"
"244","cue","00:12:34,960","00:12:39,200","I've kissed a few boys today
so I can compare it and it was nice."
"245","cue","00:12:39,280","00:12:43,040","It was one of my favorite kisses
of the whole villa so far."
"246","cue","00:12:43,120","00:12:44,200","Are we in love now?"
"247","cue","00:12:44,280","00:12:46,240","[both laughing]"
"248","cue","00:12:46,320","00:12:47,480","Yo."
"249","cue","00:12:47,560","00:12:49,440","Uh… [chuckles] …no?"
"250","cue","00:12:49,520","00:12:52,720","-Are we getting married now? Is this it?
-Yeah, I'm proposing."
"251","cue","00:12:52,800","00:12:54,120","-Okay.
-Mmm."

of course I'm vibing you more,"
"270","cue","00:13:52,400","00:13:54,360","because we've spent
so much more time together."

I owe it to myself,"

-Ah. Um…"
"376","cue","00:19:51,560","00:19:53,360","I basically just told Stella"

"378","cue","00:19:56,680","00:19:59,840","But now that you've sort of come in,
it's thrown a spanner in the works,"
"379","cue","00:19:59,920","00:20:03,360","only because the vibe's good.
I like your vibe and stuff like that."

-No, it wasn't."

-Even when you guys are holding hands"
"383","cue","00:20:11,840","00:20:14,120","and I was like… [groans, chuckles]"
"384","cue","00:20:14,200","00:20:18,640","I think it did make me realize, like,

"388","cue","00:20:28,440","00:20:32,680","-…how fast things move in here.
-Go. Yeah."
"389","cue","00:20:32,760","00:20:36,840","I really want to get to know him

"658","cue","00:33:00,840","00:33:04,040","Yeah, but your lips are proper plump

-No."
"660","cue","00:33:08,400","00:33:11,680","[Phoebe] You're fucking freaking out.

so I don't know."
"667","cue","00:33:30,600","00:33:32,840","I don't think it could end very well."

"845","cue","00:45:13,640","00:45:16,760","Yeah, I think I could see it coming
a little bit, too, to be honest."
"846","cue","00:45:16,840","00:45:19,480","And Layla, how are you feeling
about that decision?"
"847","cue","00:45:20,080","00:45:21,560","I think it was the wrong one,"
"848","cue","00:45:21,640","00:45:24,840","but gotta do what you gotta do
as a bombshell."
"849","cue","00:45:25,360","00:45:28,280","In what way did you think
it was the wrong decision?"
"850","cue","00:45:28,360","00:45:29,600","[Layla] Well, I mean,"
"851","cue","00:45:29,680","00:45:33,320","I think me and Callum are good,
so I'm not sure why she would"
"852","cue","00:45:33,400","00:45:36,240","try and get into something if, yeah,"
"853","cue","00:45:37,560","00:45:39,200","she can see how happy we both were."
"854","cue","00:45:52,560","00:45:54,160","[Sophie] Phoebe H and Jordan,"
"855","cue","00:45:55,160","00:45:56,520","Vakoo and Callum,"
"856","cue","00:45:57,400","00:45:58,720","you are now coupled up."

"860","cue","00:46:20,120","00:46:22,600","please come and face
your fellow Islanders."
"861","cue","00:46:28,720","00:46:29,720","You okay?"
"862","cue","00:46:43,160","00:46:46,520","Stella and Layla, you are now single."
"863","cue","00:46:47,800","00:46:50,960","Being single in the <i>Love Island</i> villa
leaves you vulnerable."
"864","cue","00:46:54,240","00:46:57,200","I'm afraid tonight is no exception."
"865","cue","00:46:57,800","00:46:58,800","[exhales sharply]"
"866","cue","00:47:04,400","00:47:08,200","One of you is about to be dumped
from the villa."
"867","cue","00:47:08,280","00:47:10,720","[Claudia] Fuck. Oh, my God."
"868","cue","00:47:24,160","00:47:28,440","Who goes home tonight will not be decided
by the superfans."
"869","cue","00:47:29,040","00:47:31,520","-[all groaning]
-[Mitchell] Fucking hell."
"870","cue","00:47:46,240","00:47:49,640","And it will not be decided
by your fellow Islanders."
"871","cue","00:47:49,720","00:47:50,880","[Claudia] What the fuck?"
"872","cue","00:48:00,640","00:48:03,120","There is only one person who can save you."
"873","cue","00:48:06,640","00:48:08,920","And his name is Ben."
"874","cue","00:48:09,000","00:48:11,040","-[all gasping]
-Shut up."
"875","cue","00:48:11,120","00:48:12,880","-[all muttering]
-[Sophie] Ben."
"876","cue","00:48:25,600","00:48:26,960","Oh, you're kidding."
"877","cue","00:48:27,560","00:48:30,000","-Bomb's coming in.
-[Jess] No way."

"881","cue","00:48:36,680","00:48:38,800","[laughing]"
"882","cue","00:48:38,880","00:48:40,440","[Stella] What the fuck?"
"883","cue","00:48:40,520","00:48:41,760","[Sophie] Come on down, Ben."
"884","cue","00:48:41,840","00:48:44,400","-Hey, nice to meet you, finally. Yeah.
-You too."
"885","cue","00:48:44,480","00:48:46,440","-Welcome to <i>Love Island</i>.
-Thank you so much."
"886","cue","00:48:46,520","00:48:49,200","You've joined us at
a very interesting moment, I'd say."
"887","cue","00:48:53,240","00:48:56,080","Now, Ben, are you good
at making hard decisions?"
"888","cue","00:48:56,160","00:48:59,000","Should be able to.
What have you got for me?"
"889","cue","00:48:59,080","00:49:00,640","A tricky one."
"890","cue","00:49:00,720","00:49:01,720","Yeah."
"891","cue","00:49:02,520","00:49:04,640","Say hello to Layla and Stella."

-Hope you're doing well."
"894","cue","00:49:07,600","00:49:08,600","I'm okay."
"895","cue","00:49:09,560","00:49:13,560","They are currently the only single girls
in the villa."
"896","cue","00:49:15,120","00:49:18,320","And tonight, you need to decide"
"897","cue","00:49:18,400","00:49:21,480","which one of them
you would like to couple up with."
"898","cue","00:49:25,920","00:49:28,840","You will have a five-minute date
with Layla,"
"899","cue","00:49:29,800","00:49:32,440","and then a five-minute date with Stella."
"900","cue","00:49:32,520","00:49:33,640","Okay."
"901","cue","00:49:33,720","00:49:36,560","After that, you'll return to the fire pit,"
"902","cue","00:49:36,640","00:49:41,000","and tell me which of them you would
like to couple up with and why."
"903","cue","00:49:45,680","00:49:49,960","Okay, Layla, you can head up
to the pool deck with Ben."
"904","cue","00:49:50,040","00:49:51,040","Off you go, guys."
"905","cue","00:49:51,120","00:49:53,520","-Hi, I'm Layla, by the way.
-Nice to meet you. Yeah."
"906","cue","00:50:01,040","00:50:03,080","-[Ben] Looks like this is us just here.
-Yeah."
"907","cue","00:50:03,160","00:50:04,200","[Ben] Have a seat."
"908","cue","00:50:04,280","00:50:05,640","-You too.
-Yeah."
"909","cue","00:50:05,720","00:50:07,160","So, where are you from?"
"910","cue","00:50:07,240","00:50:08,880","-How old are you?
-I'm from Melbourne."
"911","cue","00:50:08,960","00:50:10,160","Yeah. Nice. Sydney myself."
"912","cue","00:50:10,240","00:50:11,520","-So, you're in Sydney?
-Yeah."
"913","cue","00:50:11,600","00:50:12,880","-So, I'm 20.
-Okay."
"914","cue","00:50:12,960","00:50:13,960","I'm a dancer."
"915","cue","00:50:14,040","00:50:15,560","-Oh, really? Yeah.
-Yeah."
"916","cue","00:50:15,640","00:50:19,760","-So, I basically danced my whole life.
-You've got to be dedicated to your art."
"917","cue","00:50:19,840","00:50:22,000","-Oh, yeah, I'm definitely, like…
-Yeah."
"918","cue","00:50:22,080","00:50:23,720","That's my passion."
"919","cue","00:50:23,800","00:50:25,640","What do you do for work?"
"920","cue","00:50:25,720","00:50:27,440","I'm a personal trainer."
"921","cue","00:50:27,520","00:50:29,520","-Yeah.
-We have a few personal trainers."
"922","cue","00:50:29,600","00:50:31,160","Yeah, it's not really uncommon"
"923","cue","00:50:31,240","00:50:32,560","-in this place, is it?
-No."
"924","cue","00:50:32,640","00:50:35,240","What are you looking for
in a relationship?"
"925","cue","00:50:35,320","00:50:36,480","Yeah. Good question."
"926","cue","00:50:36,560","00:50:39,640","Someone that's supportive, caring."
"927","cue","00:50:39,720","00:50:42,960","I think someone that's just, like,
you know, accepting of themselves."
"928","cue","00:50:43,040","00:50:45,040","-And is comfortable in their own skin.
-Yeah."
"929","cue","00:50:45,120","00:50:46,120","That's really important"
"930","cue","00:50:46,200","00:50:48,880","because I think, in a relationship,
you wanna grow together."
"931","cue","00:50:48,960","00:50:50,880","-Yeah, I think that too.
-Yeah?"
"932","cue","00:50:50,960","00:50:54,720","For me, in a relationship,
I basically just want an equal."
"933","cue","00:50:54,800","00:50:57,760","Layla, time's up. Please head back down."
"934","cue","00:50:57,840","00:51:00,080","Okay! That was really lovely to meet you."
"935","cue","00:51:00,160","00:51:02,080","-Bye.
-Yeah, see ya."
"936","cue","00:51:13,200","00:51:15,800","Okay, Stella, you can head up to Ben now."

"938","cue","00:51:26,720","00:51:27,920","I'm well, how are you?"
"939","cue","00:51:28,000","00:51:29,560","Looking like Charlie's Angel."
"940","cue","00:51:29,640","00:51:32,040","Yeah. Stella, I love the name too."
"941","cue","00:51:32,120","00:51:34,400","-It's nice to meet you.
-Yeah, you too. Have a seat."
"942","cue","00:51:34,480","00:51:36,040","-Oh, thank you.

"943","cue","00:51:36,120","00:51:37,840","Gotta be gentlemanlike in this place."
"944","cue","00:51:37,920","00:51:40,080","-Oh, my gosh, so how are you?

"947","cue","00:51:43,800","00:51:46,160","Why are you here? You know,
you come to <i>Love Island</i>--"
"948","cue","00:51:46,240","00:51:47,720","-Yeah.
-Are you here for a fling?"
"949","cue","00:51:47,800","00:51:49,520","Are you here to find someone?"
"950","cue","00:51:49,600","00:51:51,320","Honestly, to find the love of my life."
"951","cue","00:51:51,400","00:51:53,320","-I know that's really deep.
-Good answer."
"952","cue","00:51:53,400","00:51:56,880","-We got to the chase pretty quick.
-Honestly, I feel the same."
"953","cue","00:51:56,960","00:52:00,360","And I feel like in this environment,
it's the perfect place"
"954","cue","00:52:00,440","00:52:03,040","to find the love of your life.
I think you'll like it here."
"955","cue","00:52:03,120","00:52:04,840","Yeah, it's set up that way, isn't it?"
"956","cue","00:52:04,920","00:52:06,400","-Yeah, I know. Love.
-Yeah."
"957","cue","00:52:06,480","00:52:09,080","-Yeah, that's it.
-Okay, Stella and Ben, time's up."
"958","cue","00:52:09,160","00:52:11,720","-Please head back down.

"962","cue","00:52:18,640","00:52:21,040","-Hey. How you going? Yeah.
-Hey, good."
"963","cue","00:52:21,120","00:52:23,960","Okay, Ben, first impressions
are important."
"964","cue","00:52:24,040","00:52:24,920","Mmm."
"965","cue","00:52:25,000","00:52:28,200","And that has never been truer
than right now."
"966","cue","00:52:28,280","00:52:29,720","Yeah."
"967","cue","00:52:30,720","00:52:32,080","Yeah, absolutely."

Layla and Stella."
"969","cue","00:52:37,560","00:52:41,280","And now, I only have one question for you."
"970","cue","00:52:45,040","00:52:50,760","Ben, which girl would you like
to couple up with and why?"
"971","cue","00:52:59,880","00:53:01,240","It is a hard decision."
"972","cue","00:53:03,000","00:53:04,000","So…"

derivative math sometimes."

as you know, obviously,"
"993","cue","00:54:34,000","00:54:35,240","that's why you come here."

you've been left single,"

"1019","cue","00:56:22,200","00:56:23,840","{\an8}[Callum]"
"1020","cue","00:56:24,840","00:56:26,240","-Okay?
-[Layla] Yes, I know."
"1021","cue","00:56:26,320","00:56:27,320","[Callum] Okay."
"1022","cue","00:56:29,240","00:56:31,080","Wanna help me pack?"
"1023","cue","00:56:32,760","00:56:34,960","I don't know how anything's
gonna fit, but--"
"1024","cue","00:56:35,640","00:56:39,360","[Phoebe crying] Oh, God. I can't do this.
I can't do this without you."
"1025","cue","00:56:39,440","00:56:41,520","Literally made a lifelong best friend."
"1026","cue","00:56:41,600","00:56:44,000","I couldn't be more grateful
that I got to meet Layla."
"1027","cue","00:56:44,080","00:56:46,400","Like, I love her so much."
"1028","cue","00:56:47,800","00:56:50,080","He knows what we have is special."
"1029","cue","00:56:50,160","00:56:52,960","And no one will ever
take that away from us."
"1030","cue","00:56:53,960","00:56:55,960","[sighs] Fuck."
"1031","cue","00:56:56,960","00:56:59,560","-I didn't want to cry in front of her.
-[Mitchell] Yeah."
"1032","cue","00:56:59,640","00:57:02,240","I definitely feel a bit robbed… [sniffs]"
"1033","cue","00:57:02,320","00:57:06,800","…from, like, actually finding
a genuine connection with Callum."
"1034","cue","00:57:08,120","00:57:10,200","And now it's just been taken away from me."
"1035","cue","00:57:10,280","00:57:12,000","-[Callum] Give me a hug.
-I'm really sorry."
"1036","cue","00:57:12,080","00:57:14,440","-That's all right.
-I did not know that would happen."
"1037","cue","00:57:14,520","00:57:16,120","[Callum] That's okay. You're all right."
"1038","cue","00:57:16,760","00:57:21,000","Don't stress. It's <i>Love Island</i>.
Don't worry about it. It is what it is."
"1039","cue","00:57:21,080","00:57:22,880","I'm definitely gonna miss Callum."
"1040","cue","00:57:24,680","00:57:25,720","Yeah."
"1041","cue","00:57:26,680","00:57:27,760","Yeah."
"1042","cue","00:57:32,440","00:57:34,720","-How are you feeling?
-Yeah."
"1043","cue","00:57:39,440","00:57:40,440","{\an8}I'm gonna miss you."
"1044","cue","00:57:42,880","00:57:44,240","[laughs]"
"1045","cue","00:57:46,000","00:57:48,560","I'm leaving with what I wanted anyway."
"1046","cue","00:58:00,840","00:58:02,680","I don't know what to say. [chuckles]"
"1047","cue","00:58:02,760","00:58:03,800","Oh, fuck."
"1048","cue","00:58:07,800","00:58:09,360","I've had my fair share of birds,"
"1049","cue","00:58:09,440","00:58:12,080","and there's not many birds there
that can actually upset me,"
"1050","cue","00:58:12,160","00:58:15,160","or make me emotional,
but I've known Layla a week and a half,"
"1051","cue","00:58:15,240","00:58:17,000","and she's done exactly that."
"1052","cue","00:58:18,160","00:58:20,800","Part of me does regret fucking about
with all the other birds"
"1053","cue","00:58:20,880","00:58:23,080","because I can't have my cake
and eat it too."
"1054","cue","00:58:23,160","00:58:24,960","And, unfortunately, I've lost my cake."
"1055","cue","00:58:26,120","00:58:28,360","[Phoebe groans, squeals]"
"1056","cue","00:58:28,440","00:58:29,440","[Layla groans]"
"1057","cue","00:58:29,520","00:58:30,600","{\an8}[Phoebe]"
"1058","cue","00:58:31,720","00:58:33,840","I hope that you win.
That would be awesome."
"1059","cue","00:58:33,920","00:58:34,920","Yeah."
"1060","cue","00:58:37,440","00:58:40,240","-[Jordan] Love you long time, Lay Lay.
-Yeah."
"1061","cue","00:58:40,880","00:58:42,080","Bye!"
"1062","cue","00:58:42,160","00:58:43,640","-[Jordan] See ya!
-[Phoebe H] Bye."
"1063","cue","00:58:48,480","00:58:52,560","I think me and Callum's connection
was very special, and it---"
"1064","cue","00:58:52,640","00:58:54,000","it's just been cut short."
"1065","cue","00:58:54,080","00:58:56,200","So, it's bittersweet."
"1066","cue","00:58:57,080","00:58:58,280","I don't wanna leave it."
"1067","cue","00:58:58,360","00:59:00,880","But, yeah, I trust Callum."
"1068","cue","00:59:00,960","00:59:04,240","And, yeah, I know what we have.
I'll be waiting."
