-I know."
"79","cue","00:04:50,680","00:04:54,040","But now, me reflecting on it,
I was influenced by Phoebe"
"80","cue","00:04:54,920","00:04:57,320","-and what she had to say.
-[Claudia] Okay."
"81","cue","00:04:57,920","00:05:00,800","-This has happened a lot of times, though.

Yes, they're my fault. I've told you that."

-And it's really irritating."
"87","cue","00:05:12,480","00:05:13,640","Yeah."
"88","cue","00:05:13,720","00:05:15,960","So, what's gonna happen now?"

does tell me stuff I don't need to know."

"93","cue","00:05:26,440","00:05:28,400","-What's happening?
-[Austen] Not much."

for a chat at the firepit."
"98","cue","00:05:38,600","00:05:43,000","And it was so terrifying because they
made me sit in between the two of them."
"99","cue","00:05:43,080","00:05:45,960","I just want to start by saying I love you."
"100","cue","00:05:46,040","00:05:48,280","-You're a good friend, but--
-I'm not a good friend."

"103","cue","00:05:51,600","00:05:57,800","I'm just so annoyed that everything I say
is always going back to them."
"104","cue","00:05:57,880","00:06:01,080","And I feel like your opinion
does make him do things"
"105","cue","00:06:01,160","00:06:02,440","and think about things"
"106","cue","00:06:02,520","00:06:05,800","and influence him
in a way that affects us."
"107","cue","00:06:05,880","00:06:08,520","It is, ""He said, she said."" You know?"
"108","cue","00:06:08,600","00:06:11,880","And it has just frustrated
the fuck out of me today."
"109","cue","00:06:11,960","00:06:13,280","-I would never do that to you.
-Yeah."
"110","cue","00:06:13,360","00:06:16,520","Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking
when I went to the boys."
"111","cue","00:06:16,600","00:06:19,120","I don't have an excuse for it
and I am sorry."
"112","cue","00:06:19,200","00:06:20,560","Obviously I was in the wrong"
"113","cue","00:06:20,640","00:06:23,320","and accidentally started a fight
that was not necessary."
"114","cue","00:06:23,400","00:06:25,280","It was kind of a wake-up call,
'cause I'm like,"

maybe don't tell me."

the wisest option for me."

"170","cue","00:08:50,360","00:08:52,400","…but I feel like it's kind of hard
in this environment."
"171","cue","00:08:52,480","00:08:54,600","'Cause you obviously
get to know someone so quickly."
"172","cue","00:08:54,680","00:08:58,080","-Mmm.
-But yeah, I feel like we're vibing."
"173","cue","00:08:58,160","00:08:59,720","-Yeah, me too.
-You know?"
"174","cue","00:08:59,800","00:09:02,960","That's why I'm actually enjoying
just having your presence around."
"175","cue","00:09:03,040","00:09:05,160","I like that even if it's just in the pool,"
"176","cue","00:09:05,240","00:09:06,480","-or something like that.
-I know."
"177","cue","00:09:06,560","00:09:08,760","-When you're around, I feel good. Yeah.
-You do?"
"178","cue","00:09:08,840","00:09:10,000","Good. I feel the same."
"179","cue","00:09:10,080","00:09:12,400","-I think it's-- Yeah.
-I just-- Yeah."
"180","cue","00:09:12,480","00:09:15,360","Part of me just wishes
you were in here sooner."
"181","cue","00:09:15,440","00:09:19,440","If I came in on day one and Mads was here,
it would be game over, red rover."
"182","cue","00:09:19,520","00:09:22,640","I'd be choosing her and I think I'd be set
on her for the whole journey."
"183","cue","00:09:22,720","00:09:25,880","Because so far, she's done nothing wrong.
She's just banging."
"184","cue","00:09:25,960","00:09:30,040","She's got the looks, she's got the chat,
the personality. All of it."
"185","cue","00:09:30,120","00:09:34,200","So to be fair, I don't think this island
can have any hotter birds."
"186","cue","00:09:34,280","00:09:37,000","So I'll just be set on that one bird
for the whole journey, to be honest."
"187","cue","00:09:37,080","00:09:40,120","I don't think I tell you enough. I feel
like I tell everyone else how I'm feeling."
"188","cue","00:09:40,200","00:09:43,280","I'm not the one to usually tell someone
how I'm actually feeling."
"189","cue","00:09:43,360","00:09:46,640","I feel like I keep my cards
close to my chest as well, though. Yeah."
"190","cue","00:09:46,720","00:09:50,920","Yeah. But I think I need to start being
more vulnerable, I should say."
"191","cue","00:09:51,920","00:09:54,680","But when you came in,
it's put a spring in my step again."
"192","cue","00:09:54,760","00:09:56,880","I wake up and I'm happy,
you know what I mean?"
"193","cue","00:09:56,960","00:10:00,160","When we get ready, I'm excited to see you."
"194","cue","00:10:00,240","00:10:03,000","I'm excited to see you come down
in your outfits and stuff like that."
"195","cue","00:10:03,080","00:10:04,800","-You know what I mean?
-Yeah."
"196","cue","00:10:04,880","00:10:07,280","Yeah, I know.
I'm on the same page, I feel."
"197","cue","00:10:07,360","00:10:08,320","I'm happy."
"198","cue","00:10:09,840","00:10:12,040","-Yeah, me too. Me too.
-Give me a kiss."
"199","cue","00:10:15,200","00:10:19,360","Mostly, Mads coming in this late
is definitely the ending that I wanted."
"200","cue","00:10:19,440","00:10:20,880","It was definitely worth the wait."
"201","cue","00:10:21,520","00:10:23,240","We're both on the same page."
"202","cue","00:10:41,280","00:10:42,760","What's up, brother?"
"203","cue","00:10:51,160","00:10:53,560","It definitely does feel like
me and Claudia have managed"
"204","cue","00:10:53,640","00:10:55,360","to settle everything and work it all out."
"205","cue","00:10:55,960","00:10:58,080","I think the conflict
we have in here just proves"
"206","cue","00:10:58,160","00:11:00,760","that we can resolve things very quickly…"
"207","cue","00:11:00,840","00:11:01,880","Go brush your teeth."
"208","cue","00:11:01,960","00:11:05,000","…and I cannot wait to see us
on the outside world."
"209","cue","00:11:05,080","00:11:06,920","I'm gonna brush my teeth
because I want to."
"210","cue","00:11:07,000","00:11:08,640","-[giggles]
-Not 'cause you told me to."
"211","cue","00:11:10,760","00:11:13,080","-Good night.
-Night, mate. See you in the morning."
"212","cue","00:11:17,680","00:11:20,360","I'm going to bed again
with Tina tonight on the tepee."
"213","cue","00:11:21,760","00:11:22,960","Tomorrow is a new start,"
"214","cue","00:11:23,040","00:11:25,480","and I get to wake up next to Tina,
so I'm not complaining."
"215","cue","00:11:25,560","00:11:27,880","[Tina]
I actually did have a nice day, though."
"216","cue","00:11:27,960","00:11:29,720","Choosing to spend it with me."
"217","cue","00:11:30,400","00:11:32,960","It was just nice to, like, have you there."
"218","cue","00:11:33,040","00:11:37,440","Because I felt like I haven't really
had that in a while."
"219","cue","00:11:37,520","00:11:42,000","Even though this isn't
the journey or experience I expected."
"220","cue","00:11:42,080","00:11:43,000","[chuckles]"
"221","cue","00:11:43,080","00:11:47,360","It is really nice to have found,
you know, your person in the villa."
"222","cue","00:11:47,440","00:11:49,800","-[Mitch] Titch is back.
-[Tina chuckles]"
"223","cue","00:11:49,880","00:11:52,040","I didn't expect that to be with Mitch,"
"224","cue","00:11:52,120","00:11:55,040","but I'm really enjoying
having him by my side again."
"225","cue","00:12:07,480","00:12:09,360","Whoo!"
"226","cue","00:12:09,440","00:12:10,840","Good night."
"227","cue","00:12:10,920","00:12:13,800","-Night, bro. Congratulations on today.
-Congrats."
"228","cue","00:12:13,880","00:12:16,080","If you told me before entering the villa"
"229","cue","00:12:16,160","00:12:18,960","that I'd be sleeping
with a girlfriend by this point,"
"230","cue","00:12:19,040","00:12:20,560","I would've said, ""No way in hell."""
"231","cue","00:12:20,640","00:12:22,800","Let's not waste any time."
"232","cue","00:12:22,880","00:12:24,600","But I'm over the moon about it."
"233","cue","00:12:24,680","00:12:26,440","-Come here.
-[Mitchell chuckles]"
"234","cue","00:12:26,520","00:12:29,720","I am going to bed with a boyfriend.
It still doesn't feel real."

that margarine comes from a cow"

butter was considered dairy."

"592","cue","00:30:01,840","00:30:04,960","Obviously, it comes from a cow.

"595","cue","00:30:10,320","00:30:12,800","then it probably turns into ice cream"
"596","cue","00:30:12,880","00:30:18,000","and then it probably just turns into…
cheese or something. I don't know."

"855","cue","00:45:50,640","00:45:55,080","because I feel like as soon as I set foot
in the villa, we hit it off straightaway."
"856","cue","00:45:55,160","00:45:57,560","And I feel like we laugh 24/7."
"857","cue","00:45:57,640","00:46:02,680","We have such similar personalities,

he's arrived in this villa,"
"873","cue","00:47:05,280","00:47:09,120","he showed me nothing but kindness,
care, lots of happiness and fun."

journey for a connection like that."
"875","cue","00:47:13,360","00:47:16,280","So it would be silly of me
not to explore it further."

it's going on the right path."
"885","cue","00:47:47,520","00:47:49,400","-So that's really nice.
-Great."
"886","cue","00:47:50,080","00:47:52,000","-Time's come.

some of these OGs"
"892","cue","00:48:03,960","00:48:07,040","and the connections they've formed.
I loved it every way."
"893","cue","00:48:07,120","00:48:10,040","Obviously, my <i>Love Island</i> journey
finished when Phoebe H left,"
"894","cue","00:48:10,120","00:48:13,240","but I still had a journey in here
with the others, so that's great."
"895","cue","00:48:13,320","00:48:16,280","Well, I have to say,
unfortunately, you have been left single,"
"896","cue","00:48:16,360","00:48:18,640","-and you are now dumped from the island.
-Yeah."
"897","cue","00:48:19,480","00:48:21,640","You got 30 minutes to say goodbye,"
"898","cue","00:48:22,160","00:48:24,320","and then it will be time

I know it's okay, and I know he's okay,"
"919","cue","00:49:15,360","00:49:18,280","but I just look back at all
of our memories"
"920","cue","00:49:18,360","00:49:20,400","and, like, now it's a memory,"
"921","cue","00:49:20,480","00:49:25,960","like, that-- that moment
of Jordan has come to an end."
"922","cue","00:49:27,240","00:49:28,960","-Well, let's pack the bags, hey?
-[Al] Let's do it."
"923","cue","00:49:29,040","00:49:30,440","-[Callum] Copy that.
-[Jordan clicks tongue]"
"924","cue","00:49:30,520","00:49:31,520","Super happy."

but I'm crying, you know what I mean?"

"929","cue","00:49:47,360","00:49:49,760","But honestly, like,
I cherish every moment in here."

"932","cue","00:49:54,080","00:49:57,880","and… [sniffles] …yeah, it's time
for the third wheel to leave"
"933","cue","00:49:57,960","00:50:00,520","so that they can all crack on
with their relationships."
"934","cue","00:50:01,280","00:50:02,960","-Um, yeah, stick together.
-[Austen] Yeah."

"941","cue","00:50:15,560","00:50:19,160","And he's been there for me
since day one. We're both OGs."

freaking journey if it wasn't for you."
"951","cue","00:50:50,160","00:50:53,640","You know, it's just so nice to have
that, like, girl opinion."
"952","cue","00:50:53,720","00:50:56,280","I've always had that in my life too.
So, yeah."
