"174","cue","00:08:06,280","00:08:12,200","I actually feel even more weirdly open
after the challenge, for some reason."
"175","cue","00:08:12,280","00:08:14,920","Maybe 'cause everyone was hooking up.
I don't know."
"176","cue","00:08:16,720","00:08:17,880","[chuckles]"
"177","cue","00:08:17,960","00:08:20,320","Why are you giggling? Are you shy?"
"178","cue","00:08:20,400","00:08:21,840","No, I just can't believe all this.
I don't know."
"179","cue","00:08:21,920","00:08:25,320","-I reckon maybe I'm making you shy.
-A little bit."
"180","cue","00:08:28,120","00:08:30,080","I thought you were
going in for a kiss then."
"181","cue","00:08:30,160","00:08:31,640","That would be like… [scoffs]"
"182","cue","00:08:31,720","00:08:33,720","Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Um…"
"183","cue","00:08:34,480","00:08:36,600","That was our first kiss,
and it wasn't memorable."
"184","cue","00:08:36,679","00:08:38,039","-Wasn't it?
-Nah."
"185","cue","00:08:43,039","00:08:44,720","Is this your bit?"
"186","cue","00:08:44,800","00:08:45,840","-Yeah.
-Okay."
"187","cue","00:09:03,600","00:09:06,040","-You gonna remember that one?
-Yeah."
"188","cue","00:09:06,120","00:09:08,160","-We'll pretend that one didn't happen.
-Yeah."
"189","cue","00:09:08,240","00:09:10,960","Probably will have a bit of a cuddle
and a kiss in bed tonight."
"190","cue","00:09:11,040","00:09:13,720","Nothing-- [chuckles]
Nothing more than that yet."
"191","cue","00:09:14,280","00:09:15,120","Yeah."

in front of four people."

cuddle and kissing another guy."

I feel like you've kissed,"

it's kind of on."

since I've been in the villa."

who's just walked in, for the sake of it."
"219","cue","00:10:29,440","00:10:31,240","It somewhat annoys me that you kissed."
"220","cue","00:10:31,320","00:10:34,000","And it's annoying seeing you cuddly
and affectionate."
"221","cue","00:10:34,080","00:10:36,760","And the idea of you--
The lights going off, and not knowing."
"222","cue","00:10:36,840","00:10:39,160","If I'm honest, and you got into bed
and started hooking up,"
"223","cue","00:10:39,240","00:10:40,800","-I reckon I'd pull back.
-What am I meant to do?"

-Yeah, I know, but--"

"227","cue","00:10:45,520","00:10:48,480","[inhales sharply]
Mitch is pissed off that-- I can't."
"228","cue","00:10:49,680","00:10:52,880","If I was having a one-on-one chat
with Maddy there or whatever,"
"229","cue","00:10:52,960","00:10:55,440","and then no one was around
and I just kissed her…"

and I don't like doing that to you."
"231","cue","00:10:59,280","00:11:02,240","I love Callum, but I don't think
he's gonna be good for you…"
"232","cue","00:11:02,320","00:11:03,640","-I know.
-…if you were to pursue that."
"233","cue","00:11:03,720","00:11:05,480","-You know that too.
-Do you think I'm good for you?"
"234","cue","00:11:09,320","00:11:10,520","[Mitch] This is confusing."
"235","cue","00:11:10,600","00:11:11,440","Yeah, I know."
"236","cue","00:11:11,520","00:11:14,720","But I think I've already shown to you
that I can emotionally invest"
"237","cue","00:11:14,800","00:11:16,080","and that I have that there."
"238","cue","00:11:16,160","00:11:18,840","-And you know that I would be like that.
-Yeah."
"239","cue","00:11:18,920","00:11:21,880","In the past I've always been the one
to invest in Mitch"
"240","cue","00:11:21,960","00:11:25,120","and show him that I care.
And I need a little bit of that back now"
"241","cue","00:11:25,200","00:11:28,920","because there's a huge risk
in being vulnerable with him again."
"242","cue","00:11:29,000","00:11:30,160","And as scared as he is,"
"243","cue","00:11:30,240","00:11:32,800","I think I've got double the right
to be scared."
"244","cue","00:11:32,880","00:11:34,640","So, I haven't seen that from you."
"245","cue","00:11:34,720","00:11:38,200","You haven't shown me anything--
That you want to invest in me in that way."
"246","cue","00:11:38,280","00:11:39,520","I haven't really had that."
"247","cue","00:11:39,600","00:11:43,160","And I feel like I was always the one
calling you and stuff."
"248","cue","00:11:43,240","00:11:45,280","I feel like I-I was flying to you."
"249","cue","00:11:45,360","00:11:48,240","I've shown it, and I haven't
got that from you,"
"250","cue","00:11:48,320","00:11:50,120","so I don't know if I'm gonna get it."
"251","cue","00:11:58,200","00:12:02,720","I just wanted Mitch to give me
some kind of reassurance, an investment,"
"252","cue","00:12:02,800","00:12:05,960","that he thinks there could
actually be something there."
"253","cue","00:12:06,040","00:12:10,000","'Cause I need that
so that I can feel like I'm not crazy,"
"254","cue","00:12:10,080","00:12:13,880","or pulling away from Callum
for no reason at all."
"255","cue","00:12:13,960","00:12:16,880","Because I could be hurt by him again."
"256","cue","00:12:17,560","00:12:19,720","And I don't wanna do that to myself."
"257","cue","00:12:19,800","00:12:23,560","But I just feel like--
I just, for some reason, can't help it."
"258","cue","00:12:25,960","00:12:27,160","[sniffles]"
"259","cue","00:12:31,000","00:12:33,600","It would be easy if I didn't care,
obviously, wouldn't it?"
"260","cue","00:12:33,680","00:12:37,360","But obviously I care,
which is why it's so fucking hard."
"261","cue","00:12:41,640","00:12:43,960","I don't want you to hurt me again."
"262","cue","00:12:44,040","00:12:46,240","I don't-- [scoffs]
I don't want to hurt you again."
"263","cue","00:12:46,320","00:12:49,000","I-- Just-- I can't do that again."
"264","cue","00:12:55,480","00:12:56,520","[Tina sniffles]"
"265","cue","00:13:01,360","00:13:03,240","I've always just wanted it to work."
"266","cue","00:13:03,320","00:13:07,160","And it's just frustrating, 'cause
I didn't want to feel like that anymore."
"267","cue","00:13:07,760","00:13:09,040","[sniffles]"
"268","cue","00:13:17,560","00:13:19,560","First day in the books."

"270","cue","00:13:23,240","00:13:27,240","I feel like Mitch and Callum
are the two that are on my mind."
"271","cue","00:13:27,880","00:13:29,920","[Mitch]
I just need a good sleep, to be honest."
"272","cue","00:13:30,000","00:13:34,000","And just think about where things are at,
and if I want to commit or not."
"273","cue","00:13:35,440","00:13:39,560","[Madeline] It's a little bit of a sticky
situation when you got Mitch and Callum,"
"274","cue","00:13:39,640","00:13:42,720","and then you throw Tina as well
into the mix."
"275","cue","00:13:42,800","00:13:45,560","But I'm just, sort of, going along with it"
"276","cue","00:13:45,640","00:13:47,720","and seeing how it all plays out,
I suppose."
"277","cue","00:13:47,800","00:13:49,880","The bed to myself."
"278","cue","00:13:51,600","00:13:52,920","It's more lonely over here."

I'd rather somebody else mug me off"
"341","cue","00:17:40,920","00:17:43,400","than I mug myself off.
'Cause that's just fucking dumb."
"342","cue","00:17:44,000","00:17:46,160","Maybe stop entertaining your ex-boyfriend."
"343","cue","00:17:46,240","00:17:49,680","Because that's putting red flags
on yourself, and I'm not into that."
"344","cue","00:17:49,760","00:17:52,120","What have you got from this?
What do you need to do today?"
"345","cue","00:17:52,200","00:17:53,920","Get your shit in…"
"346","cue","00:17:55,000","00:17:55,840","Yeah."
"347","cue","00:17:55,920","00:17:59,480","-O-- O--
-I don't know what the word is."
"348","cue","00:17:59,560","00:18:00,960","It starts with O."
"349","cue","00:18:01,040","00:18:02,400","-Order?
-Yes."
"350","cue","00:18:02,480","00:18:03,640","My shit in order."
"351","cue","00:18:03,720","00:18:06,960","-Get your shit in order today with Mitch.
-Yeah, I will."
"352","cue","00:18:07,840","00:18:08,840","All right, bye."
"353","cue","00:18:09,400","00:18:10,520","[chuckles]"
"354","cue","00:18:11,160","00:18:12,560","-What I was thinking…
-I'm--"
"355","cue","00:18:12,640","00:18:13,680","I was think---"
"356","cue","00:18:15,160","00:18:16,400","-[farts]
-[gasps]"
"357","cue","00:18:16,480","00:18:19,040","-Rattlesnake. Oh, my God.
-Again. [chuckles]"
"358","cue","00:18:19,960","00:18:23,480","I think I just wanna climb on Austen
and just take him with me. In me."
"359","cue","00:18:23,560","00:18:26,160","-You just want him to be you.
-Yeah, I know."
"360","cue","00:18:26,240","00:18:29,160","I wanna put Mitch in my back pocket
and carry him around everywhere I go."
"361","cue","00:18:30,000","00:18:31,520","-[farts]
-Nice."
"362","cue","00:18:31,600","00:18:34,240","-That was the rattlesnake. I promise.
-[laughs]"
"363","cue","00:18:34,320","00:18:35,800","[Phoebe] Are you in love?"
"364","cue","00:18:35,880","00:18:37,800","Bro, I've been in love for two weeks."
"365","cue","00:18:37,880","00:18:38,760","[laughs]"
"366","cue","00:18:38,840","00:18:41,240","You know when you're hugging them
and you want to say it?"
"367","cue","00:18:41,320","00:18:43,960","-But you're like, ""It's way too early.""
-Every single time."
"368","cue","00:18:44,040","00:18:46,920","Every time I'm looking at him, he goes,
""What are you thinking?"""
"369","cue","00:18:47,000","00:18:49,400","'Cause in my head I'm thinking,
""Fuck, I love you."""
"370","cue","00:18:50,000","00:18:52,480","How are we in love already?"
"371","cue","00:18:52,560","00:18:53,400","[farts]"
"372","cue","00:18:53,480","00:18:56,160","[Claudia] Phoebe and I never thought
that it was actually gonna happen."
"373","cue","00:18:56,240","00:18:59,840","But, yeah, it's-- it's happened."
"374","cue","00:18:59,920","00:19:02,720","I just know when I look at them,
and I just fucking know."
"375","cue","00:19:02,800","00:19:03,800","Yeah."
"376","cue","00:19:05,320","00:19:07,480","And I also know
'cause I look at him and think,"
"377","cue","00:19:07,560","00:19:12,400","""You're the dumbest fucking biggest
weirdo ever, and I love you for it."""
"378","cue","00:19:12,480","00:19:13,960","Ah, I think I need to shit now."
"379","cue","00:19:14,040","00:19:18,000","He's so sweet, and I'm literally
so obsessed with him. It's crazy."
"380","cue","00:19:18,080","00:19:19,640","[inhales deeply] Oh, my God."
"381","cue","00:19:25,160","00:19:27,000","-I like Phoebe a lot, bro.
-Yeah."

-[Mitchell] Yeah."
"384","cue","00:19:30,520","00:19:32,800","-I think I am.
-Can you not just fucking whisper that?"
"385","cue","00:19:32,880","00:19:36,360","-That's big news! You mad-- What?
-[Mitchell chuckling]"
"386","cue","00:19:36,440","00:19:38,680","What? He landed that on me.
I didn't know what to say."
"387","cue","00:19:38,760","00:19:39,680","I just screamed."
"388","cue","00:19:39,760","00:19:41,280","-[squealing]

"389","cue","00:19:43,320","00:19:45,280","I can't! [chuckling]"
"390","cue","00:19:45,360","00:19:50,960","Yeah, I've been doing some thinking,
and I can't really see myself without her."
"391","cue","00:19:51,040","00:19:52,840","I wanna be with her every day."
"392","cue","00:19:52,920","00:19:57,480","Um, I want us to continue what we have
in here on the outside world."
"393","cue","00:19:57,560","00:20:01,320","And I just think putting a label on it
sets it in stone."
"394","cue","00:20:01,400","00:20:02,640","I don't wanna rush into it,"
"395","cue","00:20:02,720","00:20:07,480","but it's definitely, um, something
that I'm gonna do, um, soon."
"396","cue","00:20:07,560","00:20:09,640","I'm gonna make it a big thing, 100%."
"397","cue","00:20:09,720","00:20:11,760","-[Callum] Yeah.
-I just think, ""Why fucking not?"""
"398","cue","00:20:11,840","00:20:12,920","You know?"
"399","cue","00:20:13,000","00:20:15,360","I'm not gonna
get with any other girls in here."
"400","cue","00:20:15,960","00:20:17,080","What's the next step?"
"401","cue","00:20:17,680","00:20:20,280","Girlfriend and boyfriend
or you say you love them, you know?"
"402","cue","00:20:20,360","00:20:22,400","I'm 100% into it,
and I want him to ask her"
"403","cue","00:20:22,480","00:20:25,120","because I genuinely think
they are a perfect match."
"404","cue","00:20:25,200","00:20:27,080","He is a top bloke.
I want the best for him."
"405","cue","00:20:27,160","00:20:30,480","Fucking excited. [chuckles, screams]"
"406","cue","00:20:30,560","00:20:32,480","[shushes, chuckles]"
"407","cue","00:20:32,560","00:20:34,120","-What's wrong with you?
-[chuckles]"
"408","cue","00:20:34,200","00:20:35,880","What's actually wrong with you?"
"409","cue","00:20:46,360","00:20:49,840","[narrator] <i>Maddy was concerned,</i>
<i>she was caught in a love pentagon.</i>"
"410","cue","00:20:49,920","00:20:51,720","<i>Mitch adores geometry.</i>"
"411","cue","00:20:51,800","00:20:55,120","<i>In fact, he's an expert</i>

"412","cue","00:20:55,200","00:20:56,440","-How are you?
-I'm good."
"413","cue","00:20:56,520","00:20:58,720","-How are you feeling?
-Yeah, I'm all right. You?"
"414","cue","00:20:58,800","00:20:59,640","-I'm good.
-Um--"
"415","cue","00:20:59,720","00:21:04,200","I know that, um, Callum and Tina,
obviously, kissed last night."
"416","cue","00:21:04,280","00:21:05,680","Were you upset by it or anything?"
"417","cue","00:21:05,760","00:21:07,600","I felt like she mugged me off
a little bit."
"418","cue","00:21:07,680","00:21:10,640","Is it because you still
feel something for her?"
"419","cue","00:21:10,720","00:21:11,560","Yeah."
"420","cue","00:21:11,640","00:21:15,560","I feel like, with Mitch, I'm definitely
not going to be sticking my neck out"
"421","cue","00:21:15,640","00:21:20,520","or pulling him for chats
whilst he's interested in his ex."
"422","cue","00:21:20,600","00:21:23,360","I don't want to sit here
and compromise your time here"
"423","cue","00:21:23,440","00:21:25,040","-or jeopardize your time here…
-Mmm."
"424","cue","00:21:25,120","00:21:27,560","…because I'm the one who's just
fucking running around"
"425","cue","00:21:27,640","00:21:28,800","-in a circle.
-Yeah."
"426","cue","00:21:29,440","00:21:32,600","I've got myself
in a big triangle here to be fair."
"427","cue","00:21:32,680","00:21:34,840","-You wanna talk?
-What? Surely not."
"428","cue","00:21:34,920","00:21:37,040","I want to have the open chat
with Tina and be like,"
"429","cue","00:21:37,120","00:21:39,160","""All right, tell me honestly,
where are you at?"""
"430","cue","00:21:39,240","00:21:43,600","Because I feel like so far it's just been
dodging around the point a little bit."
"431","cue","00:21:43,680","00:21:45,600","I just need her to be honest with me."
"432","cue","00:21:45,680","00:21:49,800","And then to know where Mads's head's at
so it can help me make a decision"
"433","cue","00:21:49,880","00:21:50,960","where I want to put my energy."
"434","cue","00:21:51,040","00:21:52,840","I don't wanna be stuck
in between two girls here."
"435","cue","00:21:52,920","00:21:55,520","Obviously, we're in a situation
where we're getting to know people."
"436","cue","00:21:55,600","00:21:58,200","I'm getting to know Maddy,
you're getting to Callum. That's sweet."
"437","cue","00:21:58,280","00:22:01,480","But I think I just want to know
honestly from you"
"438","cue","00:22:01,560","00:22:03,920","on where you're at and how you see things."
"439","cue","00:22:04,000","00:22:07,600","Yeah, I think it's at a point
where we don't have much time left in here"
"440","cue","00:22:07,680","00:22:08,920","and I think if we're gonna--"
"441","cue","00:22:09,760","00:22:13,640","Like-- It's holding back me doing anything
with anyone."
"442","cue","00:22:13,720","00:22:16,920","He's not doing anything nice for me,
you're not doing anything nice for me."
"443","cue","00:22:17,000","00:22:18,640","I feel like I can't talk about--"
"444","cue","00:22:18,720","00:22:20,720","I can't progress things with anyone…"
"445","cue","00:22:20,800","00:22:21,960","-There's nothing there.
-…in here at this point."
"446","cue","00:22:22,040","00:22:25,200","Yeah, so that's why I'm like,
I need to know."
"447","cue","00:22:25,960","00:22:28,160","I'm just gonna say my bit here, so…"
"448","cue","00:22:28,240","00:22:32,400","I've gone and got to know everyone,
yet I continue to be drawn back to you."
"449","cue","00:22:42,440","00:22:44,840","I feel like I'm running this way,
you're running that way,"
"450","cue","00:22:44,920","00:22:47,160","but there's a rope
pulling us both back together."
"451","cue","00:22:48,000","00:22:50,920","And I'm not gonna deny,
there's obviously something there."
"452","cue","00:22:51,800","00:22:55,160","And the only way to really find out
is to, I guess, dive into it."
"453","cue","00:22:55,240","00:22:59,000","[sighs] I just feel like I need
something big to come from Mitch."
"454","cue","00:22:59,080","00:23:00,200","I need him to be like,"
"455","cue","00:23:00,280","00:23:03,560","""Look, I think maybe now is our time
to give it another shot."""
"456","cue","00:23:03,640","00:23:06,240","And I want him
to be the one who says that."
"457","cue","00:23:06,840","00:23:07,840","I feel like…"
"458","cue","00:23:10,080","00:23:11,640","I kinda want you to, like…"
"459","cue","00:23:14,160","00:23:15,840","I just want you to be honest with me."
"460","cue","00:23:15,920","00:23:20,800","I feel like I need you to fully want me."
"461","cue","00:23:24,440","00:23:27,320","I feel like you-- I don't know
if you just want me to want you"
"462","cue","00:23:27,400","00:23:28,880","and then you're gonna do something else."
"463","cue","00:23:28,960","00:23:31,840","I-I don't know what you want
because I think it's been--"
"464","cue","00:23:31,920","00:23:33,440","If anything, it's been so unclear."
"465","cue","00:23:33,520","00:23:37,080","Yeah, 'cause it's embarrassing for me
to say that I'd want you."
"466","cue","00:23:37,160","00:23:38,800","'Cause after everything that's happened,"
"467","cue","00:23:38,880","00:23:42,080","it's like--
[sniffles] I'd look stupid, Mitch."
"468","cue","00:23:43,120","00:23:45,960","I'm just saying,
I just want someone to just want me…"
"469","cue","00:23:46,040","00:23:48,320","[crying] …and it not to be questioned."
"470","cue","00:23:50,080","00:23:52,080","'Cause after everything that's happened,"
"471","cue","00:23:52,160","00:23:55,960","I just feel like I need you
to want me 100%."
"472","cue","00:24:08,120","00:24:09,880","I know you so well"
"473","cue","00:24:09,960","00:24:12,840","and I know that
things would just come back."
"474","cue","00:24:12,920","00:24:15,240","What would need to be different?
Why didn't it work?"
"475","cue","00:24:15,320","00:24:17,680","The relationship, there was
nothing really wrong with it."
"476","cue","00:24:17,760","00:24:19,280","What would be different now?"
"477","cue","00:24:21,960","00:24:24,240","The feelings are different now
than what they were."
"478","cue","00:24:24,320","00:24:25,800","I think there is something there,"
"479","cue","00:24:25,880","00:24:29,480","and I think that it could be worth
trying to figure it out,"
"480","cue","00:24:29,560","00:24:32,160","but I'm just so nervous about it."
"481","cue","00:24:32,240","00:24:34,120","And I guess he must be feeling the same,"
"482","cue","00:24:34,200","00:24:36,960","'cause we just haven't even said
those words yet."
"483","cue","00:24:51,480","00:24:52,800","Do you want a hug?"
"484","cue","00:24:55,360","00:24:57,560","-What? [chuckles]
-Give me those eyes."
"485","cue","00:25:01,800","00:25:04,480","-[Tina] You smell nice.
-[Mitch] You smell nice too."
"486","cue","00:25:04,560","00:25:05,600","[chuckles] Huh?"
"487","cue","00:25:06,600","00:25:08,480","I'm not gonna give you a kiss. I don't--"
"488","cue","00:25:27,280","00:25:30,000","[chuckles, inhales sharply]
I mean, it felt good."
"489","cue","00:25:31,280","00:25:32,800","The kiss just felt right."
"490","cue","00:25:32,880","00:25:34,040","[chuckles]"
"491","cue","00:25:34,120","00:25:37,080","Now I feel like that's just fucked it.
Why'd you do that?"
"492","cue","00:25:37,160","00:25:40,240","-Because you gave me the eyes.
-I wasn't. It's just my face."
"493","cue","00:25:40,320","00:25:42,200","It felt right. [chuckles]"
"494","cue","00:25:43,040","00:25:44,960","He kisses me or I kiss him."
"495","cue","00:25:45,040","00:25:46,840","I don't know who did what."
"496","cue","00:25:47,480","00:25:49,800","But I'm confused.
That doesn't make any sense."
"497","cue","00:25:49,880","00:25:51,040","Didn't have anything to do--"
"498","cue","00:25:51,120","00:25:54,240","I feel like that didn't even align
with anything we'd said in our chat."
"499","cue","00:25:55,600","00:25:58,120","We'll talk later.
Just let me chat to Maddy and whatever."
"500","cue","00:25:58,200","00:26:00,480","-That was bad.
-All right. That was bad."
"501","cue","00:26:00,560","00:26:03,120","That was bad-- That didn't make any sense."
"502","cue","00:26:03,200","00:26:05,680","[Mitch] I'm not gonna lie, it felt like
it was the right thing to do."
"503","cue","00:26:05,760","00:26:07,480","-[Tina] Yeah, it did.
-[Mitch] I don't know."
"504","cue","00:26:07,560","00:26:09,160","All right. That's our secret, please."
"505","cue","00:26:09,240","00:26:11,320","-[Tina] Okay, I'm not showing anything.
-I won't be--"
"506","cue","00:26:11,400","00:26:12,680","It's written on my face."

I don't think you should run from that."

"1013","cue","00:55:23,360","00:55:27,560","You have 30 minutes to pack
and say goodbye to your fellow Islanders."""
"1014","cue","00:55:39,800","00:55:43,440","I feel so lucky to have
met someone like Jordan."
"1015","cue","00:55:43,520","00:55:47,640","He's exactly who I'm looking for."
"1016","cue","00:55:48,840","00:55:51,400","Yeah. [sighs] It just sucks. [laughs]"
"1017","cue","00:55:52,480","00:55:55,680","I can't--
I can't spend another night with him."
"1018","cue","00:55:57,280","00:56:00,560","I'm not even sad about leaving here,
it's just all you."
"1019","cue","00:56:01,680","00:56:02,840","Do you know what I mean?"
"1020","cue","00:56:11,280","00:56:12,720","[sniffs] No?"
"1021","cue","00:56:13,720","00:56:15,600","Well, what are you gonna do?"
"1022","cue","00:56:16,280","00:56:18,600","-Hang out with the boys.
-Really?"
"1023","cue","00:56:18,680","00:56:20,640","[laughs] Yeah. What else am I gonna do?"
"1024","cue","00:56:22,880","00:56:25,200","Do you think she's gonna be
asking him to leave with her?"
"1025","cue","00:56:25,280","00:56:29,400","I don't think she'll ask,
but I think that she'll hope that he does."
"1026","cue","00:56:29,480","00:56:32,320","But I feel like that will make her
feel so shitty if he stays--"
"1027","cue","00:56:32,400","00:56:35,000","-What did I mean?
-What's the point? Yeah."
"1028","cue","00:56:35,080","00:56:37,000","Do we think he's gonna leave with her
or stay?"
"1029","cue","00:56:37,080","00:56:39,680","-I don't think he's gonna leave.
-I think he's gonna stay."
"1030","cue","00:56:39,760","00:56:41,840","-I think he'll stay, hey.
-What's in store?"
"1031","cue","00:56:41,920","00:56:44,960","-But there's no more bombs.
-So, what's the point?"
"1032","cue","00:56:45,040","00:56:47,760","Is he just gonna stay
and crack on with Tina?"
"1033","cue","00:56:48,400","00:56:50,640","I know if that was Phoebe,
I would have left 100%."
"1034","cue","00:56:50,720","00:56:52,920","Yeah, me too, if that was Claudia."
"1035","cue","00:56:53,680","00:56:55,640","Who's gonna cuddle you?"
"1036","cue","00:56:56,320","00:56:57,360","No one."
"1037","cue","00:56:57,960","00:56:59,160","This sucks."
"1038","cue","00:56:59,960","00:57:02,400","He's gonna look like a dick
if he doesn't leave with her."
"1039","cue","00:57:02,480","00:57:03,480","Yeah."
"1040","cue","00:57:03,560","00:57:09,120","I have no faith that Jordan
will leave the villa for Phoebe H,"
"1041","cue","00:57:09,200","00:57:12,440","even though it's so stupid
because what else are you here for?"
"1042","cue","00:57:12,520","00:57:14,760","She was the person
that you made a connection with."
"1043","cue","00:57:14,840","00:57:16,440","So why wouldn't you leave?"
"1044","cue","00:57:17,120","00:57:19,720","No. Fuck that.
You deserve so much better, Phoebe."
"1045","cue","00:57:19,800","00:57:22,360","-[Phoebe H] Really? I don't know.
-Yes. Yes."
"1046","cue","00:57:22,440","00:57:25,160","[Phoebe H]
I thought it was cute, but I don't know."
"1047","cue","00:57:25,240","00:57:27,800","Because if it was him going home,
what would you do?"
"1048","cue","00:57:27,880","00:57:30,040","I would go with him.
Do you know what I mean?"
"1049","cue","00:57:30,120","00:57:31,960","[Stella]
I feel like I will punch him in the face."
"1050","cue","00:57:32,040","00:57:35,080","I don't know
if he genuinely likes me then."
"1051","cue","00:57:35,160","00:57:36,640","I feel bad for Phoebe too."
"1052","cue","00:57:36,720","00:57:39,360","She really, really, really liked Jordan"
"1053","cue","00:57:39,440","00:57:42,840","and put every single one
of her eggs in his basket."
"1054","cue","00:57:42,920","00:57:44,800","And yeah, he's kind of fucked her over."
"1055","cue","00:57:45,400","00:57:47,760","You deserve so much better.
I'm so fucking sorry."
"1056","cue","00:57:47,840","00:57:50,600","On behalf of all of us, that you
have to go through this shit right now."
"1057","cue","00:57:50,680","00:57:51,520","[Jess] 100%."
"1058","cue","00:57:51,600","00:57:54,080","-It's not a reflection of you.
-You are a beautiful girl."
"1059","cue","00:57:54,160","00:57:59,040","-Yeah. Why isn't he leaving with me?
-[Stella] It doesn't make sense."
"1060","cue","00:57:59,120","00:58:00,520","I tried. I tried--"
"1061","cue","00:58:00,600","00:58:02,960","It wasn't like you were
in a friendship couple either."
"1062","cue","00:58:03,040","00:58:03,880","-No.
-No."
"1063","cue","00:58:03,960","00:58:08,040","From the very start we've been intimate
in bed, and now I just feel stupid."
"1064","cue","00:58:08,120","00:58:09,800","If you really like her, you'd leave."
"1065","cue","00:58:09,880","00:58:13,680","If Al didn't leave with me
if I got dumped tonight,"
"1066","cue","00:58:13,760","00:58:15,680","I'd be laying down the law hard."
"1067","cue","00:58:15,760","00:58:19,720","He deserves to feel like shit
because he made you feel like shit."
"1068","cue","00:58:19,800","00:58:21,320","Do you know what I mean?"
"1069","cue","00:58:21,960","00:58:26,680","The girls are just a bit shocked
that you're not leaving with me."
"1070","cue","00:58:26,760","00:58:27,760","So…"
"1071","cue","00:58:28,280","00:58:29,280","They are?"
"1072","cue","00:58:30,720","00:58:34,880","[sighs] I just feel like, you know,
if you don't really"
"1073","cue","00:58:34,960","00:58:38,760","find anyone for you here."
"1074","cue","00:58:38,840","00:58:41,680","I still love every single person
that's in here though."
"1075","cue","00:58:42,880","00:58:46,160","I've been here from day one.
I love these girls. I love these boys."
"1076","cue","00:58:46,240","00:58:48,880","If it was like four weeks to go
or three weeks to go,"
"1077","cue","00:58:48,960","00:58:51,160","and I'm like,
""Fuck. I'm not gonna see for ages."""
"1078","cue","00:58:51,240","00:58:52,120","I probably would."
"1079","cue","00:58:52,200","00:58:56,160","I think they're just kind of like,
what the fuck are you gonna do?"
"1080","cue","00:58:56,240","00:58:58,800","-You won't just…
-Well, what's it to them?"
"1081","cue","00:58:59,760","00:59:04,440","I don't know. Like it does make me sad
that you're not leaving with me as well."
"1082","cue","00:59:04,520","00:59:06,520","-It's not just them.
-Mm-hmm."
"1083","cue","00:59:06,600","00:59:09,360","It's just the, like, thought,
you know what I mean?"
"1084","cue","00:59:09,440","00:59:12,120","I've told you when I get out of here,
we're gonna pursue things."
"1085","cue","00:59:12,200","00:59:14,440","Isn't that what you want to hear?"
"1086","cue","00:59:16,640","00:59:19,920","I told you how I feel,
and that's how I feel."
"1087","cue","00:59:21,680","00:59:22,560","Okay."
"1088","cue","00:59:23,600","00:59:27,040","You know, I come in here,
and I was pretty set on Jordan."
"1089","cue","00:59:27,120","00:59:30,360","So to leave without him is pretty shit."
"1090","cue","00:59:31,760","00:59:32,760","Thank you."
"1091","cue","00:59:33,920","00:59:36,600","But, you know, it is what it is."
"1092","cue","00:59:38,520","00:59:39,520","[sniffs]"
"1093","cue","00:59:42,960","00:59:45,960","It wouldn't have been serious
without you though."
"1094","cue","00:59:46,040","00:59:49,760","-You're my whole entire journey. [sniffs]
-[Islanders] Aw."
"1095","cue","00:59:49,840","00:59:52,240","-This is really sad.
-[Tina] Mmm."
"1096","cue","00:59:53,760","00:59:54,960","[Mitch] See ya."
"1097","cue","00:59:55,040","00:59:57,160","-Bye. She looks so good.
-She looks so hot."
"1098","cue","00:59:57,240","00:59:58,640","-She looks so good.
-Bye."
"1099","cue","00:59:58,720","00:59:59,800","[Jess] Bye, Phoebe."
"1100","cue","01:00:09,200","01:00:13,520","[Phoebe H] I feel sad, and I did hope
that Jordan would leave with me."
"1101","cue","01:00:13,600","01:00:19,240","It's kind of pointless for him
to stay in there, like, it is <i>Love Island.</i>"
"1102","cue","01:00:19,320","01:00:20,560","It's very upsetting."
"1103","cue","01:00:20,640","01:00:23,400","I'm not sure where I stand
with our connection,"
"1104","cue","01:00:23,480","01:00:25,520","compared to all his friends."
"1105","cue","01:00:26,080","01:00:28,800","Maybe it's not as strong
as I thought it was."
