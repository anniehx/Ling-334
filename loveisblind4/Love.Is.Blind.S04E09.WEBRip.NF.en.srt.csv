"541","cue","00:27:06,666","00:27:11,671","<i>sometimes you can get feelings</i>

"554","cue","00:27:51,252","00:27:54,172","<i>I never, ever wanted</i>

"561","cue","00:28:10,689","00:28:12,273","<i>And, um,</i>"
"562","cue","00:28:13,525","00:28:15,068","<i>yeah, I made the wrong decision.</i>"
"563","cue","00:28:15,151","00:28:18,822","<i>[sighs] I ended up realizing</i>

"565","cue","00:28:21,533","00:28:22,826","<i>And so I called it off.</i>"
"566","cue","00:28:26,996","00:28:28,373","<i>-[Annalee] So…</i>
<i>-Well-- Oh.</i>"
"567","cue","00:28:28,456","00:28:31,292","<i>Yeah, go ahead and ask him questions.</i>

<i>-[Bliss laughs]</i>"
"570","cue","00:28:37,966","00:28:42,095","<i>So, what makes you sure about Bliss</i>"
"571","cue","00:28:42,178","00:28:44,472","<i>now, that you wanna be with her?</i>"
"572","cue","00:28:44,973","00:28:48,226","<i>Because, you know,</i>
<i>her family is a big part of her life.</i>"
"573","cue","00:28:48,309","00:28:49,978","<i>And you said something about, you know,</i>"
"574","cue","00:28:50,061","00:28:52,439","<i>you weren't sure if you were gonna fit in</i>
<i>and all that.</i>"
"575","cue","00:28:52,522","00:28:55,233","<i>So, I mean, can you elaborate</i>
<i>on that a little bit more?</i>"
"576","cue","00:28:55,316","00:28:58,528","<i>So, the way I grew up, um,</i>"
"577","cue","00:28:59,821","00:29:04,743","<i>I mean, I grew up in poverty.</i>
<i>I grew up in… uh, with not much stability.</i>"
"578","cue","00:29:04,826","00:29:07,620","<i>I literally had</i>
<i>to teach myself most everything.</i>"
"579","cue","00:29:09,330","00:29:11,416","<i>I mean, my mom gave me unconditional love.</i>"
"580","cue","00:29:12,542","00:29:17,797","<i>And, uh, my mom has passed away,</i>
<i>so she's not around anymore.</i>"
"581","cue","00:29:19,174","00:29:21,968","<i>But I've been in relationships in the past</i>"
"582","cue","00:29:22,051","00:29:25,597","<i>with women who came</i>
<i>from very well-to-do families,</i>"
"583","cue","00:29:25,680","00:29:31,853","<i>where I was definitely not accepted</i>
<i>by their family because of how I grew up.</i>"
"584","cue","00:29:33,271","00:29:36,566","<i>I think that is</i>
<i>what really made me nervous</i>"
"585","cue","00:29:36,649","00:29:40,862","<i>is, like, hearing</i>
<i>about how your family is.</i>"
"586","cue","00:29:41,571","00:29:47,619","<i>So, when I talked about, like, my fear</i>
<i>about not being accepted… it's that.</i>"
"587","cue","00:29:50,163","00:29:53,666","<i>-Romeo and Juliet didn't work out, right?</i>
<i>-Right.</i>"
"588","cue","00:29:53,750","00:29:56,503","<i>[Zack] They tried.</i>
<i>They tried to make it work, but it didn't.</i>"
"589","cue","00:29:56,586","00:30:00,340","<i>Um, that's… really was one</i>
<i>of the things that scared me,</i>"
"590","cue","00:30:00,423","00:30:01,800","<i>but I think when I saw her,</i>"
"591","cue","00:30:01,883","00:30:05,303","<i>and we met for the first time</i>
<i>in the real world,</i>"
"592","cue","00:30:05,386","00:30:08,181","<i>she walked in the room,</i>
<i>and I was like, ""Oh, wow.""</i>"
"593","cue","00:30:08,264","00:30:12,101","<i>[chuckles] And I just… I felt</i>
<i>this connection with her immediately.</i>"
"594","cue","00:30:12,185","00:30:14,479","<i>And she had, like, this serious face</i>"
"595","cue","00:30:14,562","00:30:16,689","<i>'cause she didn't want me</i>
<i>to know how she felt.</i>"
"596","cue","00:30:16,773","00:30:18,983","<i>-I didn't know how I was gonna feel.</i>

"598","cue","00:30:21,569","00:30:22,570","<i>[Zack] Just warmth.</i>"
"599","cue","00:30:22,654","00:30:24,656","<i>Yeah, just this warm feeling.</i>"
"600","cue","00:30:25,240","00:30:27,116","<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Sometimes things just happen.</i>"
"601","cue","00:30:27,200","00:30:29,828","<i>And it just feels right,</i>

"602","cue","00:30:31,454","00:30:33,998","<i>[Annalee] So, you see yourself with him?</i>"
"603","cue","00:30:34,082","00:30:37,585","<i>You can see how your life is gonna be?</i>

"604","cue","00:30:37,669","00:30:38,711","<i>Yeah, I can.</i>"
"605","cue","00:30:39,462","00:30:40,713","<i>[Zack] She really does love me,</i>"
