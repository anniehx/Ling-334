of you falling asleep, Tiffany,"

in the <i>Love Is Blind</i> archives."

going to live it down."

"131","cue","00:05:38,004","00:05:39,631","and so I was just like,"

I think I'm falling in love with you."""

-[Nick] You had a good nap."

You get it, girl."

-Yeah, not my finest moment."

that song in the pods,"

gonna wake up dancing."

when I realized Brett wasn't there,"

-Yeah."

the right person for Brett"

"175","cue","00:07:29,699","00:07:31,368","Ooh, uh, without a doubt,"
"176","cue","00:07:31,451","00:07:35,330","I'd say our last dinner
before the wedding,"
"177","cue","00:07:35,455","00:07:38,124","-where I surprised her with the portraits.
-Mm-hmm."
"178","cue","00:07:38,625","00:07:41,628","Uhm, for me that was,
out of all the moments,"
"179","cue","00:07:41,753","00:07:44,172","or the moment that
I was most looking forward to,"
"180","cue","00:07:44,255","00:07:46,216","just because of the story behind it."
"181","cue","00:07:46,299","00:07:48,301","In the show there's a scene where"
"182","cue","00:07:48,385","00:07:50,470","Tiffany is like, crying on the couch,"
"183","cue","00:07:50,553","00:07:52,806","she's overwhelmed by
all the planning that's going on"
"184","cue","00:07:52,889","00:07:54,724","and we're kind of sitting like we are now"
"185","cue","00:07:54,808","00:07:57,894","and I'm just kind of telling,
""Hey, it's okay to feel that way."""
"186","cue","00:07:58,019","00:08:00,397","And that day I actually just
came back from Portland."
"187","cue","00:08:00,480","00:08:03,274","I drove three hours up which,
fun little nugget,"
"188","cue","00:08:03,358","00:08:06,027","it wasn't really mentioned in the show,
but I don't live in Seattle,"
"189","cue","00:08:06,111","00:08:07,112","I live in Portland."
"190","cue","00:08:07,404","00:08:10,198","Uh, so that day I drove up
three hours in the morning"
"191","cue","00:08:10,323","00:08:13,368","and then drove up three hours back
in the same day from work."
"192","cue","00:08:13,493","00:08:16,037","And, uh, I wanted to take her portrait,"
"193","cue","00:08:16,162","00:08:18,331","she said yes, to make her feel better."
"194","cue","00:08:18,415","00:08:21,251","And then I knew that
the last thing she would expect"
"195","cue","00:08:21,334","00:08:24,921","would be to be surprised with the pictures
from the shoot and her reaction..."
"196","cue","00:08:25,005","00:08:27,716","As a photographer,
I started doing photography in 2020."
"197","cue","00:08:27,799","00:08:29,384","I had never had my work framed."
"198","cue","00:08:29,467","00:08:31,052","So her reaction was everything."
"199","cue","00:08:31,136","00:08:32,637","So that was your work
as a photographer."
"200","cue","00:08:32,721","00:08:36,725","What do you think about the photography
of Kwame and Chelsea's little engagement..."
"201","cue","00:08:37,183","00:08:39,019","-How's that moment?
-[all exclaiming]"
"202","cue","00:08:39,185","00:08:40,770","[Brett] I haven't seen the pictures."
"203","cue","00:08:40,854","00:08:43,314","You see the pictures
you saw the whole photoshoot."
"204","cue","00:08:43,398","00:08:45,066","-[Nick] We saw the shoot.
-We loved that."
"205","cue","00:08:45,191","00:08:46,234","What was that like for you?"
"206","cue","00:08:46,317","00:08:49,070","Hi, by the way,
you guys look very coordinated"
"207","cue","00:08:49,154","00:08:50,864","and still very much in love."
"208","cue","00:08:50,989","00:08:53,366","-Thank you.
-[audience applauding, cheering]"
"209","cue","00:08:53,533","00:08:55,660","I'm going to say now
it's a signature pink."
"210","cue","00:08:55,785","00:08:57,245","You got all the shades right?"
"211","cue","00:08:57,370","00:08:58,955","Fifty shades of pink over here."
"212","cue","00:08:59,080","00:09:00,623","Fifty shades of pink. I love that."
"213","cue","00:09:00,707","00:09:03,752","What was it like watching
your engagement photoshoot together"
"214","cue","00:09:03,835","00:09:05,628","for the whole world to see?"
"215","cue","00:09:05,712","00:09:07,672","What was going on in your guys' minds?"
"216","cue","00:09:07,797","00:09:10,091","-We loved it. We loved it.
-[Vanessa chuckles]"
"217","cue","00:09:10,175","00:09:12,177","It was really a dream come true for me."
"218","cue","00:09:12,260","00:09:16,222","What the viewers didn't see was that we
connected about Calvin Klein in the pods"
"219","cue","00:09:16,306","00:09:17,766","before all of that"
"220","cue","00:09:17,849","00:09:20,727","{\an8}and we had a date
and it was called the Calvin Klein date."
"221","cue","00:09:21,352","00:09:23,563","{\an8}Yeah, Chelsea, actually,
she got me a gift,"
"222","cue","00:09:23,688","00:09:26,024","{\an8}and I opened the box
and it's a pair of boxers."
"223","cue","00:09:26,107","00:09:28,193","I'm sitting there like,
""What do I do with these?"""
"224","cue","00:09:28,276","00:09:30,028","She's like, ""Go put 'em on."""
"225","cue","00:09:30,111","00:09:33,239","-He was like, ""Here?"" I was like, ""Yes.""
-And, so..."
"226","cue","00:09:33,364","00:09:34,616","So, yeah."
"227","cue","00:09:34,699","00:09:38,787","I left the pod, put the boxes on,
came back in and we had our date."
"228","cue","00:09:38,912","00:09:40,830","-In your Calvin's?
-In both of our Calvin's."
"229","cue","00:09:40,955","00:09:44,542","I hope at this point that Calvin Klein
has sent you all some free underwear."
"230","cue","00:09:44,626","00:09:46,544","[Kwame] We're waiting for it."
"231","cue","00:09:46,669","00:09:49,881","My mom even shopped
before the show with me"
"232","cue","00:09:50,048","00:09:51,508","for my future"
"233","cue","00:09:51,591","00:09:54,886","you know, husband,
my mystery man husband's underwear."
"234","cue","00:09:54,969","00:09:56,096","I mean, God bless her."
"235","cue","00:09:56,179","00:09:58,723","Uh, but she knew this was
going to happen for me."
"236","cue","00:09:58,807","00:09:59,933","[Vanessa] Wait."
"237","cue","00:10:00,016","00:10:02,685","So the pair that you gave him
wasn't the pair your mom bought, was it?"
"238","cue","00:10:02,769","00:10:04,104","No. We just, like, went together."
"239","cue","00:10:04,187","00:10:06,106","And she was like, ""What are we doing?"""
"240","cue","00:10:06,189","00:10:07,816","Just making sure. I don't know..."
"241","cue","00:10:07,899","00:10:11,027","No, but it did arrive
after we left to film"
"242","cue","00:10:11,111","00:10:13,029","and she had to send them to the studio."
"243","cue","00:10:13,113","00:10:14,072","So it was a whole thing."
"244","cue","00:10:14,155","00:10:15,490","Did you guys print the photos?"
"245","cue","00:10:15,824","00:10:16,908","We will be. Definitely."
"246","cue","00:10:16,991","00:10:19,661","There are blank walls in our house."
"247","cue","00:10:19,744","00:10:22,664","I've been waiting
for a year for these pictures."
"248","cue","00:10:22,747","00:10:26,668","And, yeah, that date, by the way,
was the day that I knew"
"249","cue","00:10:26,751","00:10:28,878","Chelsea was the one.
I walked back in"
"250","cue","00:10:29,129","00:10:30,630","and I actually have
those boxers on right now."
"251","cue","00:10:30,713","00:10:32,090","-[Vanessa] Hey!
-[Nick] Hey!"
"252","cue","00:10:32,423","00:10:35,718","[Vanessa] We got a lucky pair
of underwear, ladies and gentlemen."
"253","cue","00:10:35,969","00:10:36,970","[all laughing]"
"254","cue","00:10:37,053","00:10:38,972","Well, guys, there were so many couples"
"255","cue","00:10:39,055","00:10:41,975","that said, ""I do,"" this season,
which is fantastic."
"256","cue","00:10:42,058","00:10:45,603","But there were also a record number
of a number of love triangles."
"257","cue","00:10:45,687","00:10:48,273","And we're going to get to each
and every one of them, don't you worry."
"258","cue","00:10:48,356","00:10:52,443","But first, we want to talk
about Chelsea, Kwame and Micah."
"259","cue","00:10:52,986","00:10:56,739","Here is a never before seen clip
of the ladies discussing Kwame"
"260","cue","00:10:56,823","00:10:59,659","and Micah's infamous
poolside chat in Mexico."
"261","cue","00:10:59,784","00:11:00,702","Check it out."
"262","cue","00:11:01,411","00:11:03,329","-Hi.
-Hi, little Frank!"
"263","cue","00:11:03,454","00:11:05,623","He's just a little teddy bear."
"264","cue","00:11:05,707","00:11:07,041","I know. You remember her?"
"265","cue","00:11:07,208","00:11:10,336","-What's your dog's name?
-No. This is Rocky."
"266","cue","00:11:10,461","00:11:12,755","Hi! What's your name, baby?"
"267","cue","00:11:12,881","00:11:14,132","...come say hi..."
"268","cue","00:11:14,215","00:11:15,967","-How are you guys doing?
-Yeah."
"269","cue","00:11:16,050","00:11:19,053","Moved in. We just got back
and it's a lot going on now."
"270","cue","00:11:19,137","00:11:21,097","Yeah. We haven't really seen
each other since Mexico."
"271","cue","00:11:21,180","00:11:23,474","And I know we kind of laughed,
like, on a weird ""No."""
"272","cue","00:11:23,558","00:11:25,476","And I think there was, like,
some confusion over,"
"273","cue","00:11:25,560","00:11:27,395","like some stuff that was like said,"
"274","cue","00:11:27,478","00:11:31,482","and I know some of the girls said that
you were like maybe feeling like upset."
"275","cue","00:11:31,983","00:11:34,193","Yeah. I mean, I'd love
to hear like your take"
"276","cue","00:11:34,277","00:11:36,321","on what happened at the welcome party."
"277","cue","00:11:36,487","00:11:39,282","I, like, made a super unfortunate joke"
"278","cue","00:11:39,365","00:11:41,409","that, like I thought
was going to be taken as funny."
"279","cue","00:11:41,492","00:11:45,455","But it wasn't and in that regard,
it's like I really do regret it."
"280","cue","00:11:45,538","00:11:46,915","What was the joke?"
"281","cue","00:11:46,998","00:11:48,875","I think it was something like to the tune"
"282","cue","00:11:48,958","00:11:51,794","of like, I don't know like cheers,
like a failed proposal"
"283","cue","00:11:51,878","00:11:53,087","or something like..."
"284","cue","00:11:53,171","00:11:55,340","{\an8}It proceeded
to be a 20 minute conversation."
"285","cue","00:11:55,465","00:11:56,299","{\an8}-Mm-hmm.
-Right?"
"286","cue","00:11:56,382","00:11:58,509","{\an8}-It just didn't need to be in that way
-Yeah."
"287","cue","00:11:58,593","00:11:59,552","{\an8}-in my opinion.
-Yeah."
"288","cue","00:11:59,677","00:12:02,555","{\an8}He was, like, upset,
and that's why he wanted to talk."
"289","cue","00:12:02,639","00:12:06,476","{\an8}But when you like, came over,
it was more to just, like, chat more."
"290","cue","00:12:06,559","00:12:08,853","{\an8}And so I feel like, from an outside
perspective, I would look at that"
"291","cue","00:12:08,937","00:12:11,522","{\an8}and be like, ""What the hell's
going on over there?"""
"292","cue","00:12:11,606","00:12:12,565","{\an8}Yeah, and I did."
"293","cue","00:12:12,649","00:12:15,401","{\an8}-That's how I would have felt too.
-And I was really uncomfortable."
"294","cue","00:12:15,485","00:12:18,237","{\an8}From what you told me in the pods,
you were breaking up with him."
"295","cue","00:12:18,321","00:12:20,990","{\an8}And from what he told me,
he was breaking up with you."
"296","cue","00:12:21,074","00:12:23,534","{\an8}So you guys were like
breaking up with each other"
"297","cue","00:12:23,618","00:12:25,078","{\an8}-in your own ways.
-Mm-hmm."
"298","cue","00:12:25,453","00:12:28,039","{\an8}I don't know your guys'
relationship, but I didn't..."
"299","cue","00:12:28,164","00:12:31,334","{\an8}Obviously, I only knew the connection
that I had with Kwame, right?"
"300","cue","00:12:31,417","00:12:35,380","{\an8}-You just wanted to be respectful to me.
-Yeah. 100 percent."
"301","cue","00:12:35,463","00:12:38,216","{\an8}-We both fell in love with the same guy.
-Mm-hmm."
"302","cue","00:12:38,883","00:12:42,512","{\an8}And to say that we weren't
threatened by each other would be a lie."
"303","cue","00:12:42,762","00:12:46,140","I do apologize if that comment,
like, stirred up, like"
"304","cue","00:12:46,474","00:12:49,435","...for literally no reason.
That wasn't my intention."
"305","cue","00:12:49,560","00:12:52,522","-Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.
-Yeah."
"306","cue","00:12:52,605","00:12:53,856","Let's get back to our night."
"307","cue","00:12:53,982","00:12:56,275","-Take her for a walk. I love you.
-Okay. Okay."
"308","cue","00:12:56,359","00:12:57,735","[speaking indistinctly]"
"309","cue","00:12:58,736","00:13:00,863","-Mm-hmm.
-Okay."
"310","cue","00:13:00,947","00:13:03,783","So, Chelsea, appeared in that clip"
"311","cue","00:13:04,033","00:13:05,952","that you and Micah had made up."
"312","cue","00:13:06,077","00:13:07,537","But that was before you saw"
"313","cue","00:13:07,620","00:13:13,001","the actual footage with audio
and some more visual of Micah and Kwame's"
"314","cue","00:13:13,418","00:13:14,919","Mexico, poolside chat."
"315","cue","00:13:15,044","00:13:17,296","What was it like
when you actually watch that?"
"316","cue","00:13:17,505","00:13:20,091","I mean, it was difficult.
It was very uncomfortable."
"317","cue","00:13:20,675","00:13:22,927","Uhm, but we had had that conversation."
"318","cue","00:13:23,094","00:13:26,931","Mike and I had had
resolution together, right?"
"319","cue","00:13:27,015","00:13:30,518","Kwame and I had had hours
long conversation that evening."
"320","cue","00:13:30,601","00:13:34,022","And you guys saw a little snippet,
you know of our conversation."
"321","cue","00:13:34,313","00:13:35,565","Uhm, so we had moved on."
"322","cue","00:13:35,690","00:13:38,192","I mean, you know,
we are happily married right now."
"323","cue","00:13:38,651","00:13:41,279","And yes, like that was
an immature comment."
"324","cue","00:13:41,404","00:13:44,824","And she understands that
and I believe that she's grown,"
"325","cue","00:13:45,408","00:13:48,453","and I do really, really
want her to be happy."
"326","cue","00:13:49,078","00:13:51,998","And if I may like, I think
that there's something"
"327","cue","00:13:52,081","00:13:54,709","that I need to say about it,
like, there's three layers."
"328","cue","00:13:54,792","00:13:56,794","There's an apology that needs to be said"
"329","cue","00:13:56,878","00:14:00,298","like first and foremost, that was really
hard for me to watch, right?"
"330","cue","00:14:00,381","00:14:03,718","It was really hard looking back at that
and being there with my wife as well."
"331","cue","00:14:03,801","00:14:05,386","That was incredibly immature of me"
"332","cue","00:14:05,470","00:14:08,056","to react that way to it
and allow it to go that way."
"333","cue","00:14:08,306","00:14:10,141","So it is incredibly unfair to my wife."
"334","cue","00:14:10,224","00:14:11,350","And I'm so sorry, baby."
"335","cue","00:14:11,434","00:14:15,313","And like, I'm so glad
that we've grown so much together."
"336","cue","00:14:15,438","00:14:16,522","And, [clears throat]"
"337","cue","00:14:16,606","00:14:18,816","I'm sorry I let my ego
get the best of me in that moment."
"338","cue","00:14:18,900","00:14:20,777","I'll never do that again, you know?"
"339","cue","00:14:20,860","00:14:24,364","And then the second layer is, I need
to say sorry to Chelsea's family, right?"
"340","cue","00:14:24,447","00:14:28,451","It's not an accurate representation of our
relationship and definitely not of me."
"341","cue","00:14:28,534","00:14:30,953","I definitely let that moment
get the best of me."
"342","cue","00:14:31,245","00:14:34,832","And so they all need to know
how much I care and love for my wife"
"343","cue","00:14:34,916","00:14:37,168","you know, and she means
the world to me, you know?"
"344","cue","00:14:37,251","00:14:41,089","And I think a third layer is
for all the people who are out there"
"345","cue","00:14:41,172","00:14:44,634","who believe in us, who saw that,
and it gave them a really negative light."
"346","cue","00:14:44,842","00:14:47,303","You know? So all in all like,"
"347","cue","00:14:47,804","00:14:49,889","I accept completely what happened there."
"348","cue","00:14:49,972","00:14:53,393","And I know that I needed to grow
to get past moments like that."
"349","cue","00:14:53,476","00:14:57,063","And I think that I'm in a better spot, and
that puts us in a much better spot, so."
"350","cue","00:14:57,146","00:14:59,732","[Nick] Just to be clear,
after the two of you were engaged,"
"351","cue","00:14:59,816","00:15:02,819","you no longer had feelings for Micah?
That ship had sailed."
"352","cue","00:15:02,902","00:15:06,114","I did not.
Uhm, so little did the world know"
"353","cue","00:15:06,239","00:15:08,658","there were a couple of dates
that Micah"
"354","cue","00:15:08,741","00:15:12,787","and I had that were long scheduled dates
that we both ended early, right?"
"355","cue","00:15:12,870","00:15:13,788","Like at that point in time,"
"356","cue","00:15:13,871","00:15:16,707","by the time we broke up,
we weren't having"
"357","cue","00:15:16,791","00:15:18,459","as much fun in our dates anymore."
"358","cue","00:15:18,626","00:15:20,294","So we both knew it was coming up."
"359","cue","00:15:20,670","00:15:24,215","You know, it just had to be that
that final step to make it happen."
"360","cue","00:15:24,549","00:15:28,428","But I think we both knew, like our hearts
were going in different directions."
"361","cue","00:15:28,636","00:15:31,556","And they were directions
that were definitely better for us"
"362","cue","00:15:31,722","00:15:33,474","and we needed to take that step."
"363","cue","00:15:34,475","00:15:38,479","But to be fair,
thinking back to your reaction,"
"364","cue","00:15:39,188","00:15:41,441","to your and Micah's last date in the pods."
"365","cue","00:15:41,524","00:15:44,694","It seemed like it was a fairly
emotional reaction on your part."
"366","cue","00:15:44,986","00:15:47,572","If you knew that you were kind of heading
in separate directions, why was it..."
"367","cue","00:15:47,864","00:15:50,366","Why were you so emotionally moved
at that moment, it hurt, right?"
"368","cue","00:15:50,533","00:15:51,742","It hurt, right?"
"369","cue","00:15:51,826","00:15:52,910","It hurts no matter what."
"370","cue","00:15:52,994","00:15:55,872","We've all had those moments
where you separate from someone"
"371","cue","00:15:55,955","00:15:58,082","that you know isn't right for you,
and you still sit on your bed"
"372","cue","00:15:58,166","00:15:59,917","and eat ice cream for a month, right?"
"373","cue","00:16:00,084","00:16:02,795","Right, like, we go through those moments.
You have to process your emotions"
"374","cue","00:16:02,879","00:16:06,007","regardless of whether my heart
was in a different place and I moved on,"
"375","cue","00:16:06,090","00:16:08,634","I still needed to process out the pain."
"376","cue","00:16:08,718","00:16:09,677","-[Vanessa] Okay.
-Right."
"377","cue","00:16:09,760","00:16:12,847","And so I, I think that I'm okay
with what, what happened."
"378","cue","00:16:12,930","00:16:14,140","It helped me process it."
"379","cue","00:16:14,223","00:16:16,976","I do think I should have handled
the break-up immediately,"
"380","cue","00:16:17,059","00:16:18,311","um, with a bit more maturity"
"381","cue","00:16:18,394","00:16:20,980","because I think we would've gotten
more closure before Mexico."
"382","cue","00:16:21,063","00:16:23,774","But all in all, I think
that there was some pain in it"
"383","cue","00:16:23,858","00:16:26,068","and that's how I processed it."
"384","cue","00:16:26,944","00:16:29,363","[Vanessa] Something I noticed
in that clip was, um,"
"385","cue","00:16:29,447","00:16:31,282","Chelsea, you were telling Micah,"
"386","cue","00:16:31,365","00:16:33,576","""Hey, you know, you told me
you were gonna break up with him."
"387","cue","00:16:33,659","00:16:35,286","But he told me he'd break up with you."""
"388","cue","00:16:35,369","00:16:37,747","And Micah, you kind of made
a little smirk, you went, mm."
"389","cue","00:16:37,830","00:16:39,248","But you didn't say anything."
"390","cue","00:16:39,332","00:16:42,376","So, was that not
your recollection of things,"
"391","cue","00:16:42,460","00:16:46,297","that he was gonna break up with you?
You were always gonna break up with him."
"392","cue","00:16:46,380","00:16:47,215","Um..."
"393","cue","00:16:48,966","00:16:51,093","You know,
I don't think I was aware of that,"
"394","cue","00:16:51,177","00:16:52,595","{\an8}but I don't think it matters."
"395","cue","00:16:52,678","00:16:55,723","{\an8}Um, I think... I mean, the proof is here."
"396","cue","00:16:55,806","00:16:57,558","{\an8}You know, they're happy, they're married."
"397","cue","00:16:57,642","00:17:01,020","Regard, regardless of the cadence...
It happened and it doesn't matter."
"398","cue","00:17:01,103","00:17:04,023","You know, we both knew
what was best for ourselves"
"399","cue","00:17:04,106","00:17:05,566","and we, we followed that."
"400","cue","00:17:05,650","00:17:07,902","Yeah. So, why did... Chelsea,"
"401","cue","00:17:07,985","00:17:10,071","why, did Kwame actually say that to you"
"402","cue","00:17:10,154","00:17:11,072","or were you just in the moment,
thinking like,"
"403","cue","00:17:11,155","00:17:12,949","""You told him you were gonna break up,"
"404","cue","00:17:13,032","00:17:15,284","but he told me
he was gonna break up with you""?"
"405","cue","00:17:15,368","00:17:18,579","I was so focused on my relationship
with Kwame. Like, the whole time."
"406","cue","00:17:18,663","00:17:21,749","And I think that is a little bit why,
at the pool party, I was like, ""Whoa!"""
"407","cue","00:17:22,542","00:17:25,461","But I wasn't involved and like,
I really didn't know how deeply"
"408","cue","00:17:25,545","00:17:27,922","-they had fallen for each other.
-[Vanessa] No, right."
"409","cue","00:17:28,005","00:17:30,258","I'm saying, specifically, when you guys
were walking the dogs,"
"410","cue","00:17:30,341","00:17:33,427","you actually said, ""Kwame told me
he was gonna break up with you."""
"411","cue","00:17:33,511","00:17:35,012","[Kwame] I have a break-up note in my..."
"412","cue","00:17:35,096","00:17:36,013","It's still in my note book."
"413","cue","00:17:36,097","00:17:37,515","[Vanessa] So, you did.
So that wasn't a lie."
"414","cue","00:17:37,598","00:17:39,267","-You did, you just never got to it.
-[Kwame] Yeah, I did."
"415","cue","00:17:39,350","00:17:41,352","Yeah, I never got to..
Like, we got into that conversation."
"416","cue","00:17:41,435","00:17:44,480","I think it was really, really difficult
because I had written something heartfelt."
"417","cue","00:17:44,564","00:17:45,773","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-That was meaningful."
"418","cue","00:17:45,856","00:17:48,276","Because I think we meant something
to each other in that moment."
"419","cue","00:17:48,359","00:17:49,318","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-And so, obviously,"
"420","cue","00:17:49,402","00:17:52,905","you reflect back on it
and you think the conversation just went,"
"421","cue","00:17:52,989","00:17:55,408","""Hey, I think we should go
in our separate directions,"""
"422","cue","00:17:55,491","00:17:56,617","and that hurt to hear"
"423","cue","00:17:56,701","00:17:59,579","because regardless of how little
the connection felt at that point"
"424","cue","00:17:59,662","00:18:02,039","-there was some depth to it at some point.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"425","cue","00:18:02,123","00:18:04,333","And so, we just...
I felt like in that moment"
"426","cue","00:18:04,417","00:18:06,085","I needed a bit more closure and acceptance"
"427","cue","00:18:06,168","00:18:09,005","that we did mean something
to each other at some point"
"428","cue","00:18:09,088","00:18:10,923","and it helped us
get to this part of our journey"
"429","cue","00:18:11,007","00:18:13,801","where we are now blessed
to go in the better direction."
"430","cue","00:18:13,884","00:18:14,719","[Vanessa] Yes."
"431","cue","00:18:14,802","00:18:16,345","And it felt like it was like,
snip, bye-bye."
"432","cue","00:18:16,429","00:18:17,388","-[Vanessa] Yes.
-That's what hurt."
"433","cue","00:18:17,471","00:18:18,431","-[Nick] Yeah.
-That's all."
"434","cue","00:18:18,514","00:18:20,766","And I will say, something that you guys
also didn't see was"
"435","cue","00:18:20,850","00:18:24,645","in the lounge, I went up to Micah
and I was gonna have like, a truce."
"436","cue","00:18:24,729","00:18:28,399","Like, ""You know what?
Whatever is meant to be will be."
"437","cue","00:18:28,482","00:18:30,234","I really do believe that for both of us."""
"438","cue","00:18:30,318","00:18:32,570","Before I could even speak, she was like,"
"439","cue","00:18:32,653","00:18:34,697","""Wait, I'm breaking up with him
right now."""
"440","cue","00:18:34,780","00:18:36,115","I was like, ""Oh."""
"441","cue","00:18:36,198","00:18:37,575","Like, I was like, ""Okay."""
"442","cue","00:18:37,658","00:18:40,244","It was a little bit shocking to me,
but, like, that's what she said,"
"443","cue","00:18:40,328","00:18:41,746","that's exactly what she did."
"444","cue","00:18:42,371","00:18:44,790","Um, I, obviously,
Kwame was on the other side."
"445","cue","00:18:44,874","00:18:45,708","I couldn't talk to him."
"446","cue","00:18:45,791","00:18:48,794","I don't know, I can't fact-check anything.
I'll just take what she's saying."
"447","cue","00:18:48,878","00:18:51,047","You know?
And she went in there and did that."
"448","cue","00:18:51,130","00:18:52,423","[Nick] So, thinking back,
do you feel like,"
"449","cue","00:18:52,506","00:18:54,759","do you feel like Micah maybe played
with Kwame's emotions"
"450","cue","00:18:54,842","00:18:56,969","a little bit, in the pods, or not so much?"
"451","cue","00:18:57,053","00:18:59,764","It's such a complicated experience, right?"
"452","cue","00:18:59,847","00:19:03,225","I mean, you're falling in love
with multiple people."
"453","cue","00:19:03,309","00:19:06,646","And I'm gonna give everyone
the benefit of the doubt."
"454","cue","00:19:06,729","00:19:11,442","It's a difficult process and, you know,
we all cope in different ways."
"455","cue","00:19:11,984","00:19:13,778","And I'm not saying that, you know..."
"456","cue","00:19:14,528","00:19:16,572","Condoning, like,
messing around with somebody"
"457","cue","00:19:16,656","00:19:18,699","or putting someone else down
to make you feel better,"
"458","cue","00:19:18,783","00:19:20,201","but it is a complex process"
"459","cue","00:19:20,284","00:19:22,328","and we all deal with it
the best that we can."
"460","cue","00:19:22,828","00:19:24,955","I love how much you have reflected."
"461","cue","00:19:25,039","00:19:27,083","Specifically, Kwame, when you answered"
"462","cue","00:19:27,166","00:19:29,460","the question about earlier about
reflecting and wanting to apologize"
"463","cue","00:19:29,543","00:19:33,089","to your wife and to, you know,
your families and to everybody watching,"
"464","cue","00:19:33,172","00:19:34,507","because you did post on Instagram."
"465","cue","00:19:34,590","00:19:37,343","You said, ""I get it, if you don't believe
in it, I get it from what you've seen,"""
"466","cue","00:19:37,426","00:19:39,720","but you've had fun
falling in love with each other."
"467","cue","00:19:39,804","00:19:41,597","-[Kwame] Yeah.
-So, if you had this chance right now"
"468","cue","00:19:41,681","00:19:43,849","to tell everybody watching,
what do you wanna tell"
"469","cue","00:19:43,933","00:19:47,937","that you think you wanna address
that is misunderstood about y'all?"
"470","cue","00:19:49,063","00:19:50,189","About our relationship?"
"471","cue","00:19:50,272","00:19:51,607","[Vanessa] Or about you guys in general."
"472","cue","00:19:52,024","00:19:54,402","I mean, I'll say this, too.
Every single conversation"
"473","cue","00:19:54,485","00:19:56,779","that Kwame had after Mexico, with Micah,"
"474","cue","00:19:56,862","00:19:57,697","[Kwame clears throat]"
"475","cue","00:19:57,780","00:20:00,700","was pushing a narrative that wasn't ours."
"476","cue","00:20:02,451","00:20:04,704","[Vanessa] Kwame, anything you think
is misunderstood?"
"477","cue","00:20:05,371","00:20:07,331","[Kwame] Um, I mean,"
"478","cue","00:20:07,415","00:20:10,543","I think, all in all,
at the end of the day,"
"479","cue","00:20:10,626","00:20:12,712","by the time
we were going to step out of the pods"
"480","cue","00:20:12,795","00:20:15,131","and by the time
we were going to get to Mexico,"
"481","cue","00:20:15,589","00:20:16,924","it was going to be with Chelsea."
"482","cue","00:20:17,007","00:20:19,051","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-There's no second guesses."
"483","cue","00:20:19,135","00:20:21,595","There's no, ""I wish this""
or ""I wish that."""
"484","cue","00:20:21,679","00:20:23,889","Everything happened
the way it was supposed to."
"485","cue","00:20:23,973","00:20:25,766","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-And we are here because of that."
"486","cue","00:20:25,850","00:20:27,393","If there was confusion of,"
"487","cue","00:20:27,476","00:20:29,770","""Did you think
you'd end up with Micah?"" No."
"488","cue","00:20:30,646","00:20:32,648","We both knew where we were headed."
"489","cue","00:20:33,065","00:20:34,859","We were taking the same journey."
"490","cue","00:20:35,109","00:20:37,403","Micah started telling me
she was connecting with Paul,"
"491","cue","00:20:37,611","00:20:40,489","and I said, ""Hey, I'm starting
to connect with someone else, too"
"492","cue","00:20:40,865","00:20:43,075","and I wanted to let you know.""
I wanted to be direct."
"493","cue","00:20:43,159","00:20:45,661","I was starting to have
strong feelings for Chelsea."
"494","cue","00:20:45,745","00:20:49,290","I think it was only fair,
as everyone going through this experiment,"
"495","cue","00:20:49,373","00:20:51,625","to address that with the people
we were connected with."
"496","cue","00:20:52,042","00:20:53,335","-Right?
-[Vanessa] I do appreciate"
"497","cue","00:20:53,419","00:20:55,588","that you told her,
""I'll see her. I'll talk to her."""
"498","cue","00:20:55,671","00:20:56,756","You were being human"
"499","cue","00:20:56,839","00:20:59,925","and you said your ego got in the way,
and you were taking it in, visually."
"500","cue","00:21:00,009","00:21:03,179","But I respect that you guys
have taken time to reflect"
"501","cue","00:21:03,262","00:21:04,180","and you look stronger."
"502","cue","00:21:04,263","00:21:05,931","Yeah, we were strong,"
"503","cue","00:21:06,015","00:21:08,476","but if anything, this whole thing
made us even stronger."
"504","cue","00:21:08,559","00:21:09,560","Hey now. All right."
"505","cue","00:21:09,643","00:21:11,854","[audience cheering, clapping]"
"506","cue","00:21:11,937","00:21:14,774","[Vanessa] One of my favorite parts"
"507","cue","00:21:14,857","00:21:19,737","of this season

"684","cue","00:29:14,419","00:29:20,342","I think that throughout this...
Watching that back was really difficult."
"685","cue","00:29:21,593","00:29:24,638","It was in multiple parts
and it was a lot with Zack"
"686","cue","00:29:24,721","00:29:29,309","and with the way things went out,
with the girls in the lounge as well."
"687","cue","00:29:29,393","00:29:32,562","I feel like I really came into it
in a selfish perspective"
"688","cue","00:29:32,646","00:29:34,356","of it was just me on the show,"
"689","cue","00:29:35,148","00:29:38,360","what I was going through
and what no one else was going around..."
"690","cue","00:29:39,152","00:29:40,570","No one else is experiencing."
"691","cue","00:29:41,321","00:29:44,992","And kind of like,
I wasn't there to make friends."
"692","cue","00:29:45,075","00:29:46,785","But in reality, what that..."
"693","cue","00:29:47,452","00:29:49,746","How that affected other people."
"694","cue","00:29:49,830","00:29:52,374","I would say my intention
was never to hurt anyone,"
"695","cue","00:29:52,457","00:29:53,583","but my impact did."
"696","cue","00:29:54,251","00:29:56,628","And it wasn't only seeing
the girls I hurt,"
"697","cue","00:29:56,712","00:30:01,425","which I will say, I privately apologized
to to all of them,"
"698","cue","00:30:01,842","00:30:03,427","but I think it was deeper than that."
"699","cue","00:30:03,510","00:30:06,388","I think it was seeing people
that were bullied, too,"
"700","cue","00:30:06,471","00:30:09,725","and them re-watching that
and then feeling the pain that they felt"
"701","cue","00:30:11,310","00:30:13,395","when they were growing up
in those experiences."
"702","cue","00:30:13,478","00:30:17,816","So, I think I'm going through it,
all of it,"
"703","cue","00:30:17,899","00:30:22,112","and just experiencing and thinking
about everything that happened."
"704","cue","00:30:23,488","00:30:26,867","And I know that's not the person
that I want to be and that I'm not."
"705","cue","00:30:26,950","00:30:31,913","And it was... It's painful that
that's the image I'm left with on my,"
"706","cue","00:30:31,997","00:30:33,957","you know, three weeks of this journey."
"707","cue","00:30:35,751","00:30:38,920","So, obviously, initially,
you and Zack were together."
"708","cue","00:30:39,004","00:30:41,089","Went to Mexico together.
I'm just curious, Bliss,"
"709","cue","00:30:41,965","00:30:45,010","when you watched that part
of the season back, how did you..."
"710","cue","00:30:45,093","00:30:49,139","How did you feel about how Irina
was treating Zack out of the pods?"
"711","cue","00:30:49,222","00:30:52,434","Well, you know, we talked so much
about everything that happened."
"712","cue","00:30:52,517","00:30:57,481","He told me every little detail.
I was prepared to see it, but I wasn't..."
"713","cue","00:30:57,564","00:31:00,359","I was very shocked, honestly,
and I was super disappointed."
"714","cue","00:31:00,692","00:31:03,028","And I just really hope
that you grow from this."
"715","cue","00:31:03,820","00:31:07,949","It's just sad to see someone
so wonderful be treated so poorly."
"716","cue","00:31:08,033","00:31:09,534","And I just hope that you can grow."
"717","cue","00:31:09,618","00:31:13,372","[audience cheering, clapping]"
"718","cue","00:31:13,997","00:31:16,708","[Vanessa] Zack, do you think Irina
ever took your relationship seriously?"
"719","cue","00:31:19,336","00:31:20,170","No."
"720","cue","00:31:21,213","00:31:23,715","I would love to speak on that if I can."
"721","cue","00:31:24,508","00:31:26,426","It really hurts to hear Zack say that."
"722","cue","00:31:26,968","00:31:29,679","I genuinely think that me and Zack
weren't right for each other."
"723","cue","00:31:30,305","00:31:35,435","And when I came into this experience,
I felt like I was in a place to find..."
"724","cue","00:31:35,519","00:31:38,647","I was ready to meet somebody
I wanna spend the rest of my life with."
"725","cue","00:31:39,564","00:31:42,734","And I think that when I went into it,
I came into it thinking,"
"726","cue","00:31:42,818","00:31:46,321","""If there's anybody there that doesn't
feel right, I'm cutting it off."""
"727","cue","00:31:46,405","00:31:49,908","Zack was the last guy that I chose
and I still think he's the best guy,"
"728","cue","00:31:49,991","00:31:51,451","and there's a reason I chose him."
"729","cue","00:31:51,827","00:31:52,661","[Vanessa] Yeah."
"730","cue","00:31:53,120","00:31:55,872","And I think that we weren't meant to be,"
"731","cue","00:31:55,956","00:31:58,542","and we can see it from day one
from seeing each other."
"732","cue","00:32:00,085","00:32:02,963","to this day, this was the best guy
that I met on the show,"
"733","cue","00:32:03,046","00:32:04,673","and I meant that,
I came with the intention."
"734","cue","00:32:04,756","00:32:07,300","But to be true to myself.
If it wasn't going to work out,"
"735","cue","00:32:07,384","00:32:09,928","it felt super wrong for me and Zack."
"736","cue","00:32:10,011","00:32:13,223","So to sit here and hear him say
that it wasn't true for me,"
"737","cue","00:32:13,306","00:32:17,227","and that's okay, I understand.
I completely treated you so poorly, Zack."
"738","cue","00:32:17,310","00:32:20,730","And nobody deserves
to be treated like that at all,"
"739","cue","00:32:20,814","00:32:23,191","and I belittled you
and made you feel really small."
"740","cue","00:32:23,275","00:32:25,235","And I was going through a lot mentally,"
"741","cue","00:32:25,318","00:32:27,654","does not mean that
it's an excuse to do that."
"742","cue","00:32:27,737","00:32:29,156","Looking back, I'm sorry."
"743","cue","00:32:29,239","00:32:31,575","Do you want to add?
I know I'm rambling a little."
"744","cue","00:32:31,658","00:32:34,870","But I love you guys' relationship.
I love seeing it unfold."
"745","cue","00:32:34,953","00:32:38,790","It was truly one of my favorites,
and that might sound cheesy or cringey,"
"746","cue","00:32:38,874","00:32:43,170","but seeing Zack be so loved by you
and seeing the things I maybe didn't like,"
"747","cue","00:32:43,253","00:32:46,965","and seeing you just be in awe
of every little thing he did?"
"748","cue","00:32:47,048","00:32:49,301","I'll hopefully have that for myself too."
"749","cue","00:32:49,384","00:32:51,678","And I truly mean that for the both of you."
"750","cue","00:32:51,761","00:32:53,930","[Nick] Zack, I feel like you
may want to say something."
"751","cue","00:32:54,014","00:32:56,933","Do you believe the words that are coming
out of her mouth right now,"
"752","cue","00:32:57,017","00:32:59,519","-or do you still have skepticism?
-[crowd laughing]"
"753","cue","00:33:00,020","00:33:00,854","[Nick] That's up for you to answer."
"754","cue","00:33:00,937","00:33:02,939","-I'm not.
-Yeah, the... [sighs]"
"755","cue","00:33:03,857","00:33:05,150","[Vanessa] Be comfortable."
"756","cue","00:33:08,361","00:33:12,574","You did a lot of things
that hurt a lot of people, including me."
"757","cue","00:33:13,033","00:33:18,079","And I mean, you only see
ten percent of it on the camera."
"758","cue","00:33:18,163","00:33:20,165","There was so much stuff that happened"
"759","cue","00:33:20,248","00:33:23,210","that was [chuckles]
just unbelievable."
"760","cue","00:33:23,293","00:33:27,547","If we're real,
you went on this show to get famous."
"761","cue","00:33:27,631","00:33:29,633","[crowd gasping, cheering]"
"762","cue","00:33:34,513","00:33:38,975","But look, I... I forgive you."
"763","cue","00:33:39,059","00:33:42,479","Like, I genuinely,
100 percent forgive you, Irina."
"764","cue","00:33:42,562","00:33:44,981","I do, too, and we've talked
about that already."
"765","cue","00:33:45,065","00:33:47,317","I really don't hold anything against you.
And I know,"
"766","cue","00:33:47,400","00:33:50,987","there's so many people out here,
that want to attack the people..."
"767","cue","00:33:51,071","00:33:54,991","the cast on this show,
and you have no idea,"
"768","cue","00:33:55,075","00:33:59,246","everybody who made a mistake on this show,
it has been punishment enough"
"769","cue","00:33:59,329","00:34:01,957","for the entire world
to see them at their worst."
"770","cue","00:34:02,040","00:34:04,876","Trust me, Irina, Micah,"
"771","cue","00:34:04,960","00:34:08,129","everybody here who did some...
We all did something stupid."
"772","cue","00:34:08,213","00:34:11,174","And so, I 100 percent forgive you, Irina."
"773","cue","00:34:11,258","00:34:13,552","And, I... [chuckles]
You know, I..."
"774","cue","00:34:13,635","00:34:16,513","My last comment, I stand on that.
I have receipts."
"775","cue","00:34:16,596","00:34:18,723","But the only receipt
I think the world should see"
"776","cue","00:34:18,807","00:34:21,268","are the ones I posted
on my Instagram today."
"777","cue","00:34:21,351","00:34:24,187","-[crowd gasping]
-And with that said,"
"778","cue","00:34:24,271","00:34:26,523","I really believe, Irina,"
"779","cue","00:34:26,606","00:34:29,609","that you will become
an amazing person one day."
"780","cue","00:34:29,693","00:34:33,989","I believe that, and I forgive you
for what happened."
"781","cue","00:34:34,072","00:34:35,657","And I hope the world does, too."
"782","cue","00:34:36,241","00:34:37,993","-[crowd applauding]
-[Bliss] Mm-hmm."
"783","cue","00:34:39,160","00:34:40,078","Wow."
"784","cue","00:34:40,829","00:34:44,249","I mean, I could feel
the emotion in your voice"
"785","cue","00:34:44,332","00:34:46,501","and you touched on something very true."
"786","cue","00:34:46,585","00:34:49,212","The experience that you all went through
is one that's so unique"
"787","cue","00:34:49,296","00:34:51,214","that only you all can understand,"
"788","cue","00:34:51,298","00:34:54,342","and then you have the perspective
of watching it back,"
"789","cue","00:34:54,426","00:34:58,722","and I think in that is
a great learning opportunity, um,"
"790","cue","00:34:58,805","00:35:00,807","to see maybe the way that you came off"
"791","cue","00:35:00,890","00:35:04,019","in ways that you didn't
necessarily know if that's true."
"792","cue","00:35:04,102","00:35:06,479","And we can all learn
from those moments, you know."
"793","cue","00:35:06,563","00:35:10,233","Irina, you mentioned
when you were talking to Zack"
"794","cue","00:35:10,317","00:35:14,154","about wanting to be true to you
and this process and wanting to find love."
"795","cue","00:35:14,237","00:35:17,824","But I couldn't help but remember
when you guys did break it off in Mexico,"
"796","cue","00:35:17,907","00:35:20,660","you're brushing your teeth and he's like,
""I've had a terrible time."""
"797","cue","00:35:20,744","00:35:23,496","You ask, ""You been thinking about Bliss?""
He's like this the whole time."
"798","cue","00:35:23,580","00:35:27,250","And you were like, ""I was ready to leave
the moment I saw you."""
"799","cue","00:35:27,334","00:35:30,378","And you kind of said under your breath.
I was like, ""Time out. Rewind."
"800","cue","00:35:30,462","00:35:31,838","""Did she just say that?"""
"801","cue","00:35:31,921","00:35:33,840","Right when you saw him in the Reveal,
you're like, ""And I'm out."""
"802","cue","00:35:33,923","00:35:37,677","But you continued to go on."
"803","cue","00:35:37,761","00:35:40,513","Yeah, I would love to talk about that."
"804","cue","00:35:40,597","00:35:44,059","I think when I saw Zack, I will say
he was completely my type, on paper."
"805","cue","00:35:44,142","00:35:47,103","Looks-wise, brown hair.
It wasn't anything about how he looked."
"806","cue","00:35:47,187","00:35:49,773","And I know that people are booing me
for that and saying,"
"807","cue","00:35:49,856","00:35:52,484","""Oh, it's all about looks,""
but it was gut instinct,"
"808","cue","00:35:52,567","00:35:55,028","and I know Zack felt that
same gut instinct when"
"809","cue","00:35:55,111","00:35:57,989","Marshall put the blanket over you
and you felt it wasn't right."
"810","cue","00:35:58,073","00:36:01,242","I felt that when I saw you
and it was what I was praying for."
"811","cue","00:36:01,326","00:36:02,494","I went into this thinking,"
"812","cue","00:36:02,577","00:36:04,913","""If there's a moment where something
isn't right, I'm cutting it out."""
"813","cue","00:36:04,996","00:36:08,667","I'd have times in the middle of my dates
where I'd leave and be, ""This isn't right."
"814","cue","00:36:08,750","00:36:11,544","""You're not a good person,
it doesn't feel right."" And I'd leave."
"815","cue","00:36:11,628","00:36:14,172","I felt that when I saw Zack,
it was instant uncomfort,"
"816","cue","00:36:14,255","00:36:18,093","I felt scared, and I didn't feel safe,
and it wasn't safe in the sense of,"
"817","cue","00:36:18,176","00:36:19,636","I thought he was gonna
hurt me or something."
"818","cue","00:36:19,719","00:36:22,263","It didn't feel comfortable for me."
"819","cue","00:36:22,347","00:36:26,267","I went back and had a panic attack
and actually asked to go home."
"820","cue","00:36:26,351","00:36:29,270","And I said, ""This doesn't feel right.
This doesn't feel right."""
"821","cue","00:36:29,354","00:36:31,898","And I couldn't.
I mean, they asked me,"
"822","cue","00:36:31,981","00:36:34,567","""Hey, let's go to Mexico
and have a conversation with Zack."""
"823","cue","00:36:34,651","00:36:37,904","And I said, ""Absolutely,
he deserves that 100 percent,"""
"824","cue","00:36:37,987","00:36:40,365","but I didn't want to continue
because I knew"
"825","cue","00:36:40,448","00:36:43,576","how hard that felt inside me
and how I was like,"
"826","cue","00:36:43,660","00:36:46,454","""This isn't going to work.""
And he felt it, too."
"827","cue","00:36:46,538","00:36:48,665","A 100 percent, Zack.
And it still hurts me,"
"828","cue","00:36:48,748","00:36:51,835","sorry, to say that you think
I went on the show to get famous,"
"829","cue","00:36:51,918","00:36:55,755","and I thank you guys for forgiving me.
But that wasn't the reason. And I..."
"830","cue","00:36:55,839","00:36:59,134","And so, me going to Mexico is me being,
""I'm going to give Zack a chance."""
"831","cue","00:36:59,217","00:37:01,344","This whole time,
it's me saying I'm giving him a chance."
"832","cue","00:37:01,428","00:37:03,596","In reality, I'm treating him
like absolute shit."
"833","cue","00:37:03,680","00:37:08,518","I feel like I couldn't have a voice
to tell Zack what I was really feeling,"
"834","cue","00:37:08,601","00:37:10,103","and Zack is really good with his words."
"835","cue","00:37:10,186","00:37:12,355","He's a lawyer.
He's amazing with his words."
"836","cue","00:37:12,439","00:37:13,940","But I was in this moment I felt trapped,"
"837","cue","00:37:14,023","00:37:16,735","and I couldn't tell him
how it was going on with me."
"838","cue","00:37:16,818","00:37:19,446","[Vanessa] I don't think it was just words.
There were a lot of actions."
"839","cue","00:37:19,529","00:37:20,405","There was pillows over your head."
"840","cue","00:37:20,488","00:37:22,240","-There were eye rolls.
-[crowd applauding]"
"841","cue","00:37:22,323","00:37:24,701","But I do want to say,
And this is something that I..."
"842","cue","00:37:24,784","00:37:27,495","I always talk about this,
and I'm so sorry to cut you off."
"843","cue","00:37:27,579","00:37:29,664","You said you grew up...
And I was wanting to root for you"
"844","cue","00:37:29,748","00:37:31,541","in the very beginning
because you had a hard time."
"845","cue","00:37:31,624","00:37:35,295","People making fun of you, for your acne.
And you felt you were the victim."
"846","cue","00:37:35,378","00:37:36,880","So you knew what it was like
to be on that end."
"847","cue","00:37:36,963","00:37:37,964","Mm-hmm."
"848","cue","00:37:38,047","00:37:40,258","So then to redo it
and to treat people that way"
"849","cue","00:37:40,341","00:37:43,636","almost seems like it was
an actual malicious thought."
"850","cue","00:37:43,720","00:37:47,265","I do want to say that that moment
with the pillow over my face,"
"851","cue","00:37:47,348","00:37:51,102","watching it back,
I was like, absolute jerk move of me."
"852","cue","00:37:51,186","00:37:53,354","I was literally having
a panic attack on that pillow."
"853","cue","00:37:53,438","00:37:55,440","-And it doesn't look so 'cause
-[Nick clears throat]"
"854","cue","00:37:55,523","00:37:57,650","I keep talking on it.
And I was crying."
"855","cue","00:37:57,734","00:38:00,987","I was crying under the pillow, and
I couldn't tell Zack how I was feeling."
"856","cue","00:38:01,070","00:38:02,822","But I guess also
in hindsight, so sorry..."
"857","cue","00:38:02,906","00:38:05,200","I need to hear Bliss's
point of view on all this"
"858","cue","00:38:05,283","00:38:08,369","because my understanding
is there was a DM sent as well,"
"859","cue","00:38:08,453","00:38:12,707","while you were with Zack, to Bliss,
saying you dodged a bullet."
"860","cue","00:38:12,791","00:38:15,210","-Yeah, she did say that.
-[crowd gasping]"
"861","cue","00:38:15,293","00:38:18,421","I want to start off by saying
this was a year ago."
"862","cue","00:38:18,505","00:38:21,758","This is such a small little blip
in me and Zack's love story"
"863","cue","00:38:21,841","00:38:23,927","and we have moved on.
I'm willing to address it now"
"864","cue","00:38:24,010","00:38:27,806","and I don't wanna talk about it further
because I just don't care anymore."
"865","cue","00:38:27,889","00:38:29,891","-[Nick] Okay.
-There was a message sent."
"866","cue","00:38:29,974","00:38:31,434","You know this. We all know it."
"867","cue","00:38:31,518","00:38:34,896","You did tell me when you landed in Mexico
that I dodged a bullet."
"868","cue","00:38:34,979","00:38:38,316","But you also texted him,
""I'm so sorry. Let's talk."
"869","cue","00:38:38,399","00:38:40,151","""I hope something
happens with you and Bliss."""
"870","cue","00:38:40,235","00:38:41,319","So, I don't know."
"871","cue","00:38:41,402","00:38:44,155","I think you can have panic attacks
and you can have trouble with"
"872","cue","00:38:44,239","00:38:46,574","mental illness, and that's totally valid."
"873","cue","00:38:46,658","00:38:48,618","But you're turning around
and doing malicious things,"
"874","cue","00:38:48,701","00:38:53,331","and you're acting in really cruel ways.
It's hard to reconcile those two things."
"875","cue","00:38:53,414","00:38:55,083","-It really is.
-[crowd applauding]"
"876","cue","00:38:55,166","00:38:59,587","But again, I just hope that
you can take accountability."
"877","cue","00:38:59,671","00:39:01,506","There's so much power
in taking responsibility"
"878","cue","00:39:01,589","00:39:04,217","when you do something wrong
rather than giving excuses,"
"879","cue","00:39:04,300","00:39:07,554","and I hope you can do that
and you can move forward and move on."
"880","cue","00:39:07,637","00:39:10,557","Yeah, I do want to say I wanted
to bring that up here,"
"881","cue","00:39:10,640","00:39:13,434","that I sent you that message
and a few hours later,"
"882","cue","00:39:13,518","00:39:16,729","or a few days later, that was completely
out of line for me to say."
"883","cue","00:39:16,813","00:39:20,775","And along with Zack, I think a few days
or hours when I got home"
"884","cue","00:39:20,859","00:39:23,611","and had time to process things
and emotions again, like,"
"885","cue","00:39:23,695","00:39:27,282","nothing I did was okay.
The way I acted, the way I was talking."
"886","cue","00:39:27,365","00:39:31,035","I can't sit here also and blame it.
It was a huge part of mental health,"
"887","cue","00:39:31,119","00:39:34,205","but I also don't want to blame that
because this isn't okay, um..."
"888","cue","00:39:34,289","00:39:37,000","But I texted Zack as well,
and I said, ""I'm so sorry"""
"889","cue","00:39:37,083","00:39:40,545","'cause it kind of hit me, that I was,
I've never treated someone so poorly,"
"890","cue","00:39:40,628","00:39:42,797","and I meant that and I do apologize."
"891","cue","00:39:42,881","00:39:46,759","And by the way, I want to say,
I think you came on here today"
"892","cue","00:39:46,843","00:39:49,262","knowing that this was going
to happen to some extent,"
"893","cue","00:39:49,345","00:39:51,723","and I want to applaud you
for coming here and confronting it"
"894","cue","00:39:51,806","00:39:55,476","and dealing with it, and for whatever
it's worth, for apologizing for it."
"895","cue","00:39:55,560","00:39:58,438","Micah, I want to ask you
because Irina and Paul"
"896","cue","00:39:58,521","00:40:02,525","also had some interaction in Mexico
that you were aware of."
"897","cue","00:40:02,609","00:40:06,154","I know you had a conversation about it,
but how was that for you"
"898","cue","00:40:06,237","00:40:09,532","watching those flirty kind of moments
back on the show?"
"899","cue","00:40:09,616","00:40:11,993","Because at that point,
you guys were friends."
"900","cue","00:40:12,076","00:40:15,788","Yeah, um,
it was hard to see, of course."
"901","cue","00:40:15,872","00:40:20,376","I'm sure it was hard to see,
like Chelsea had to see with Kwame and I."
"902","cue","00:40:20,460","00:40:23,379","Um, I think we both
disrespected our partners"
"903","cue","00:40:23,463","00:40:27,717","and we disrespected,
you know, other people here."
"904","cue","00:40:27,800","00:40:31,137","Um, I think the only thing
both of us can do"
"905","cue","00:40:31,220","00:40:34,390","is own up to it and apologize
and hope to do better."
"906","cue","00:40:34,474","00:40:39,062","Um, I think the fact that we were
really close made it a little harder."
"907","cue","00:40:39,145","00:40:40,605","I felt like I was blindsided."
"908","cue","00:40:40,688","00:40:43,983","It made me question
a lot of things with Paul, um,"
"909","cue","00:40:44,067","00:40:46,027","and that's probably what hurt me the most."
"910","cue","00:40:46,110","00:40:47,904","[Nick] Yeah, and Paul,
for your part of it,"
"911","cue","00:40:47,987","00:40:51,282","how is that, for you watching it back?
How do you feel about that?"
"912","cue","00:40:51,366","00:40:54,744","That flirting moment. And were there
others that happened off-camera?"
"913","cue","00:40:54,827","00:40:59,374","{\an8}No. There weren't. But I will say that
I think, from my perspective,"
"914","cue","00:40:59,457","00:41:02,543","{\an8}I was very secure in our relationship."
"915","cue","00:41:02,627","00:41:05,171","{\an8}And I knew exactly where Zack stood."
"916","cue","00:41:05,254","00:41:11,260","Um, Micah and I, we had delineated
what the boundaries were of what's okay,"
"917","cue","00:41:11,344","00:41:14,639","you know, in terms of flirting
and what is infidelity, you know?"
"918","cue","00:41:14,722","00:41:16,474","That was physical intimacy,
that was the boundary."
"919","cue","00:41:16,557","00:41:18,685","And I knew what I was willing to do
and what I wasn't."
"920","cue","00:41:18,768","00:41:20,812","And so, it's for the very same reason"
"921","cue","00:41:20,895","00:41:25,233","that I wasn't threatened with the
Micah and Kwame flirting scenario."
"922","cue","00:41:25,316","00:41:26,859","Like, um..."
"923","cue","00:41:26,943","00:41:29,654","You know, we knew
what we were capable of doing"
"924","cue","00:41:29,737","00:41:33,408","and what we were going to do
and what we weren't and, yeah."
"925","cue","00:41:33,491","00:41:35,827","[Nick] There was a line,
and you don't feel you crossed that?"
"926","cue","00:41:35,910","00:41:41,249","Yeah, I knew that there was no danger
in talking to Irina, flirting, whatever."
"927","cue","00:41:41,332","00:41:45,086","There was no danger of affecting
either our relationship"
"928","cue","00:41:45,169","00:41:47,922","or their relationship.
Or talk thereof."
"929","cue","00:41:48,006","00:41:50,550","The beauty of this reunion
is for you guys to get a chance"
"930","cue","00:41:50,633","00:41:54,971","to say your piece, clear things up,
like rumors about Babs."
"931","cue","00:41:55,054","00:41:58,474","-[scattered laughs]
-You know, I got to talk about this video."
"932","cue","00:41:58,558","00:42:01,060","Y'all, by the way,
on the Internet, are savage."
"933","cue","00:42:01,144","00:42:04,063","Y'all found a video
and you slowed it down"
"934","cue","00:42:04,147","00:42:06,441","where Paul is leaving the bridal suite,"
"935","cue","00:42:06,524","00:42:10,903","you'll put an arrow where he's trying to
move his way out of the bridal suite,"
"936","cue","00:42:11,738","00:42:13,781","tapping a little bridesmaid's tush."
"937","cue","00:42:13,865","00:42:16,826","Let's take a look at this video,
see what you think about it."
"938","cue","00:42:18,077","00:42:20,913","<i>All our history's hazy</i>"
"939","cue","00:42:21,664","00:42:25,001","<i>Like driving in the pouring rain</i>"
"940","cue","00:42:25,793","00:42:30,048","<i>Are we in too deep to heal</i>"
"941","cue","00:42:31,007","00:42:32,341","The music!"
"942","cue","00:42:33,176","00:42:35,762","I mean, I will say
the bridesmaid seemed to like it."
"943","cue","00:42:35,845","00:42:38,222","-[crowd laughing]
-Clearly she was one that was Team Paul."
"944","cue","00:42:38,306","00:42:39,307","Paul is here now."
"945","cue","00:42:39,390","00:42:41,476","-What the heck? Seriously.
-Okay."
"946","cue","00:42:41,559","00:42:44,937","So, to imply that
that was anything more than me"
"947","cue","00:42:45,021","00:42:49,108","just gesturing, you know, acknowledging
that I was squeezing past her,"
"948","cue","00:42:49,192","00:42:52,487","kind of bumped into her shoulder,
is literally absurd."
"949","cue","00:42:52,570","00:42:54,280","Literally just walking out of the door."
"950","cue","00:42:54,363","00:42:57,867","And gesturing, just like,
""Hey, sorry I bumped into you."" Like..."
"951","cue","00:42:57,950","00:42:59,077","-That was it.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"952","cue","00:42:59,160","00:43:01,662","-[Paul chuckles]
-[Vanessa] Sorry I bumped into you."
"953","cue","00:43:01,746","00:43:05,291","-You can bump into me anytime, baby.
-Bump into you anytime."
"954","cue","00:43:05,374","00:43:07,543","I will say one of the most
shocking moments,"
"955","cue","00:43:07,627","00:43:11,422","speaking of you, Paul,
was leaving Micah heartbroken"
"956","cue","00:43:11,506","00:43:13,883","at the altar after saying no."
"957","cue","00:43:13,966","00:43:16,552","And Micah, if Paul had said yes,"
"958","cue","00:43:18,054","00:43:19,806","would you guys be married today?"
"959","cue","00:43:21,974","00:43:23,142","Um..."
"960","cue","00:43:31,567","00:43:32,485","Sorry."
"961","cue","00:43:33,486","00:43:36,489","-[Vanessa] It's okay.
-[Nick] Take your time."
"962","cue","00:43:43,121","00:43:43,996","[sniffles]"
"963","cue","00:43:46,624","00:43:48,501","[Vanessa] I got the golden tissue box."
"964","cue","00:43:48,584","00:43:50,211","-[sniffles]
-[Vanessa] Thank you."
"965","cue","00:43:50,711","00:43:52,004","I'm sorry."
"966","cue","00:43:53,131","00:43:55,633","All the pressure's been off me,
so I kind of forgot I was here. [chuckles]"
"967","cue","00:43:55,716","00:43:56,717","-[sniffles]
-[crowd laughing]"
"968","cue","00:43:56,801","00:43:57,677","Um..."
"969","cue","00:43:58,970","00:44:00,138","I mean..."
"970","cue","00:44:02,306","00:44:05,476","I knew in that moment
that the only thing I could do"
"971","cue","00:44:05,560","00:44:08,062","when I was asked first,
was to give Paul the opportunity"
"972","cue","00:44:08,146","00:44:10,523","to answer first, and I don't care..."
"973","cue","00:44:10,606","00:44:12,400","I don't care what anyone
thinks why I did it."
"974","cue","00:44:12,483","00:44:17,071","That was my life and my relationship
and a real marriage that was on the line."
"975","cue","00:44:17,572","00:44:20,241","And I knew that I was going to say yes."
"976","cue","00:44:22,285","00:44:23,536","And..."
"977","cue","00:44:24,829","00:44:28,541","I didn't want to spend the rest
of our life, if he was to say yes,"
"978","cue","00:44:28,624","00:44:31,169","wondering if he did it
not to embarrass me."
"979","cue","00:44:32,003","00:44:35,798","Or... I needed to know
he did it for him,"
"980","cue","00:44:35,882","00:44:39,302","and the only way I could get that answer
was for him to answer first."
"981","cue","00:44:39,385","00:44:40,219","[sniffles]"
"982","cue","00:44:40,303","00:44:42,889","-And I'm happy I did.
-[Nick] Yeah."
"983","cue","00:44:42,972","00:44:44,098","[Nick] Paul, how does that make you feel?"
"984","cue","00:44:44,182","00:44:47,059","Knowing that she was ready to say yes."
"985","cue","00:44:49,145","00:44:52,398","I don't know.
It's difficult, I think. Um..."
"986","cue","00:44:54,275","00:44:57,403","It's always more clear in retrospect."
"987","cue","00:44:58,988","00:45:00,281","-I don't know.
-[sniffles]"
"988","cue","00:45:00,364","00:45:01,574","[Nick] Let me ask you this."
"989","cue","00:45:01,657","00:45:04,994","If she had not kind of punted to you
and had gone first"
"990","cue","00:45:05,077","00:45:07,163","and said yes, would that have changed?"
"991","cue","00:45:07,246","00:45:10,875","So my knee-jerk reaction is no."
"992","cue","00:45:10,958","00:45:16,464","Because I don't believe in doing things...
making decisions based on other people."
"993","cue","00:45:16,547","00:45:20,301","I really do think that, you know,
you should own your truth,"
"994","cue","00:45:20,384","00:45:23,346","and that serves both people
in a relationship."
"995","cue","00:45:23,429","00:45:26,807","So I don't think that I would have.
But I don't know what that feels like,"
"996","cue","00:45:26,891","00:45:30,144","to have your partner choosing you,
saying yes, affirming you."
"997","cue","00:45:30,227","00:45:31,771","-[Nick] Mm-hmm.
-I don't know what that feels like,"
"998","cue","00:45:31,854","00:45:34,023","so I don't know.
I can't say with 100 percent certainty"
"999","cue","00:45:34,106","00:45:35,733","that I wouldn't have changed my answer."
"1000","cue","00:45:35,816","00:45:38,069","But my knee-jerk reaction is
I'd have said the same."
"1001","cue","00:45:38,152","00:45:39,820","-I don't know.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1002","cue","00:45:39,904","00:45:44,283","Micah, there was a moment
after you ran off, um,"
"1003","cue","00:45:44,367","00:45:47,286","and they were interviewing Paul,
that he said,"
"1004","cue","00:45:47,370","00:45:52,833","he couldn't see marrying you
because he couldn't see you as a mom."
"1005","cue","00:45:53,709","00:45:56,128","When you watch that,
how did that make you feel?"
"1006","cue","00:45:57,672","00:45:58,589","Terrible."
"1007","cue","00:46:02,259","00:46:06,722","I felt like it was the worst thing
that could be said about me."
"1008","cue","00:46:08,432","00:46:10,309","[Vanessa] You think it's 'cause you know
you would have been a great mom"
"1009","cue","00:46:10,393","00:46:13,145","and he knew how important
it was for you to be a mom?"
"1010","cue","00:46:13,229","00:46:15,189","It's something I've talked about
since the pods,"
"1011","cue","00:46:15,272","00:46:17,984","how important having family
was to me. [sniffles]"
"1012","cue","00:46:18,943","00:46:22,488","[sobs] My mom wasn't supposed to
be able to have children."
"1013","cue","00:46:22,571","00:46:29,370","The fact that we even survived [sniffling]
my birth was a miracle."
"1014","cue","00:46:29,453","00:46:31,080","Um... [sniffles]"
"1015","cue","00:46:31,163","00:46:33,749","I didn't have any siblings.
I didn't have a big family,"
"1016","cue","00:46:33,833","00:46:36,544","and it's something
I've always wanted so bad."
"1017","cue","00:46:36,627","00:46:38,921","And I've said that.
I've always said that."
"1018","cue","00:46:39,005","00:46:44,093","We even had a date
just a few days before our wedding,"
"1019","cue","00:46:44,176","00:46:47,888","and he said to me, he was like,"
"1020","cue","00:46:47,972","00:46:50,975","""What if I don't want
to have kids down the line?"""
"1021","cue","00:46:51,058","00:46:52,601","And he brought that to me."
"1022","cue","00:46:52,685","00:46:55,938","And I was so upset, 'cause you know
how important that is to me."
"1023","cue","00:46:56,522","00:46:59,442","So to hear him say that,
and I've never heard this before,"
"1024","cue","00:46:59,525","00:47:02,361","he's never said that to me.
I've never heard about it"
"1025","cue","00:47:02,445","00:47:04,739","after the wedding.
So it was just a shock."
"1026","cue","00:47:05,698","00:47:06,949","It hurt."
"1027","cue","00:47:07,033","00:47:09,452","[Vanessa] What was it that made you say
I can't see her as mom"
"1028","cue","00:47:09,535","00:47:11,370","or the mother to my children?
Our children?"
"1029","cue","00:47:11,454","00:47:15,958","Yeah, I think I phrased that really,
unfairly towards her."
"1030","cue","00:47:16,042","00:47:18,753","I don't think that it was a reflection"
"1031","cue","00:47:18,836","00:47:21,630","of what she was capable of
or anything like that."
"1032","cue","00:47:21,714","00:47:24,383","I think the better way to phrase that"
"1033","cue","00:47:24,467","00:47:26,343","would have been
""I can't see us as parents"""
"1034","cue","00:47:26,427","00:47:29,346","because I couldn't envision myself,
as she pointed out,"
"1035","cue","00:47:29,430","00:47:33,476","I couldn't envision myself as a father
just as much as I couldn't see in her,"
"1036","cue","00:47:33,559","00:47:35,644","and I want to take 100 percent"
"1037","cue","00:47:35,728","00:47:39,398","accountability and responsibility
for my half of that equation."
"1038","cue","00:47:39,482","00:47:41,192","I think it's very possible that the reason"
"1039","cue","00:47:41,275","00:47:45,738","why I couldn't see that in her
was that I wasn't inspiring that in her."
"1040","cue","00:47:45,821","00:47:49,450","You know, she didn't feel comfortable
with showing that side of her."
"1041","cue","00:47:49,533","00:47:50,701","[Vanessa] I thought she said she did."
"1042","cue","00:47:50,785","00:47:54,371","She just talked about it from since
the pods up until your wedding day."
"1043","cue","00:47:54,455","00:47:57,958","It wasn't evident to me.
In my vision of the future?"
"1044","cue","00:47:58,042","00:47:59,168","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-That wasn't there."
"1045","cue","00:48:00,336","00:48:01,670","er, whatever you want."
"1046","cue","00:48:01,754","00:48:04,632","[Vanessa] You wanted actions.
Like, you wanted her..."
"1047","cue","00:48:04,715","00:48:06,884","I just wanted
to be able to see it, I guess. Like..."
"1048","cue","00:48:07,301","00:48:08,886","-I can't.
-What would make you see that?"
"1049","cue","00:48:08,969","00:48:10,638","I'm sorry. Just so I understand."
"1050","cue","00:48:10,721","00:48:11,931","I think..."
"1051","cue","00:48:12,014","00:48:13,766","It's a little bit ineffable, right?"
"1052","cue","00:48:13,849","00:48:17,144","So, it's kind of an exuding,
a nurturing presence."
"1053","cue","00:48:17,228","00:48:19,688","It's something that you feel.
There's not really, like..."
"1054","cue","00:48:20,564","00:48:23,317","tangible, kind of like, things,
I don't think."
"1055","cue","00:48:24,318","00:48:26,320","[Nick] You didn't see enough
of a nurturing presence in Micah?"
"1056","cue","00:48:26,403","00:48:27,696","Is that what you're saying?"
"1057","cue","00:48:27,780","00:48:29,490","-You didn't see that?
-Yeah. I think so."
"1058","cue","00:48:29,573","00:48:31,784","There was some of that. Um..."
"1059","cue","00:48:32,660","00:48:34,161","But like I said, I'm not saying"
"1060","cue","00:48:34,245","00:48:37,206","that there's anything
about her that is not nurturing."
"1061","cue","00:48:37,289","00:48:40,584","It's that I didn't give
her the proper inspiration"
"1062","cue","00:48:40,668","00:48:42,670","and motivation to show that side of her."
"1063","cue","00:48:43,379","00:48:46,257","[Vanessa] Micah, is this explanation
making sense and settling with you?"
"1064","cue","00:48:46,340","00:48:48,092","Or are you as confused as I am?"
"1065","cue","00:48:48,175","00:48:49,301","-I'm just as confused.
-[audience laughs]"
"1066","cue","00:48:49,385","00:48:50,719","[Vanessa]
No, I don't mean it disrespectfully,"
"1067","cue","00:48:50,803","00:48:54,223","because I understand what you're saying,
but I feel you're dodging the issue."
"1068","cue","00:48:54,306","00:48:55,808","Like, if there was a moment you're like,"
"1069","cue","00:48:55,891","00:48:59,603","""Yeah, that's just not something
I see in a wife or a mother."""
"1070","cue","00:48:59,687","00:49:02,815","Um, or just you were done
at that point. So..."
"1071","cue","00:49:03,816","00:49:06,694","you don't feel like
this is giving you closure."
"1072","cue","00:49:08,154","00:49:09,155","I mean..."
"1073","cue","00:49:11,448","00:49:14,034","when I saw it,
obviously, I was heartbroken."
"1074","cue","00:49:14,118","00:49:15,828","It really hurt and I reached out."
"1075","cue","00:49:15,911","00:49:19,123","And he made me feel like
I understood what you were saying."
"1076","cue","00:49:19,206","00:49:21,167","I was like,
""Okay, I get what you're saying,"
"1077","cue","00:49:21,250","00:49:24,253","but the way you're just going back
and forth and backpedaling"
"1078","cue","00:49:24,336","00:49:27,464","and saying all these different things,
it just makes me feel, like, worse."""
"1079","cue","00:49:28,257","00:49:30,509","[Vanessa] You know what's crazy?
You love your mom,"
"1080","cue","00:49:30,593","00:49:32,845","and I thought Micah and your mom..."
"1081","cue","00:49:32,928","00:49:34,054","-[audience chuckles]
-...were like doppelgangers."
"1082","cue","00:49:34,138","00:49:36,056","Like Frick and Frack,
they got along great."
"1083","cue","00:49:36,140","00:49:38,100","Even you said, ""We have the same hair."""
"1084","cue","00:49:38,184","00:49:40,102","I'm like,
""My God, this is, like, happening."""
"1085","cue","00:49:40,186","00:49:43,772","But there was just something missing
that you didn't find in her."
"1086","cue","00:49:43,856","00:49:46,692","Sure, yeah,
they're aesthetically doppelgangers,"
"1087","cue","00:49:46,775","00:49:49,278","but obviously extremely
different individuals,"
"1088","cue","00:49:49,361","00:49:52,573","personality and character-wise
and all of these things."
"1089","cue","00:49:52,656","00:49:55,784","But, um, that's not to say that
there wasn't something missing."
"1090","cue","00:49:55,868","00:49:57,995","I think that that part of it is true."
"1091","cue","00:49:58,078","00:50:00,789","But it's just kind of ""It is what it is."""
"1092","cue","00:50:00,873","00:50:05,461","You know, some people, uh, connect
in that way and are able to show that,"
"1093","cue","00:50:05,544","00:50:09,298","and that just wasn't evident
in our relationship at that point in time."
"1094","cue","00:50:09,381","00:50:11,050","So, I would like to say"
"1095","cue","00:50:11,133","00:50:15,763","that it wasn't something that I believed
was just never going to occur."
"1096","cue","00:50:15,846","00:50:19,225","I thought that that could be something
that was developed over time."
"1097","cue","00:50:19,308","00:50:22,478","I was entirely open to that occurring,"
"1098","cue","00:50:22,561","00:50:25,231","um, but it didn't happen
in the time timeline that we have."
"1099","cue","00:50:25,314","00:50:27,191","[Vanessa]
Didn't involve in the experience."
"1100","cue","00:50:27,274","00:50:29,777","Then why did I not hear
about it until Friday?"
"1101","cue","00:50:29,860","00:50:31,445","I've never heard that from you."
"1102","cue","00:50:31,528","00:50:32,905","You've never brought that up to me."
"1103","cue","00:50:32,988","00:50:35,491","Um, we were done dating,
like, 12 months ago."
"1104","cue","00:50:35,574","00:50:36,951","[audience chuckles]"
"1105","cue","00:50:37,034","00:50:38,661","You didn't tell me while we were engaged."
"1106","cue","00:50:38,744","00:50:40,788","You didn't tell me
when we dated after the show."
"1107","cue","00:50:40,871","00:50:43,374","I've never heard
this until I saw it on TV."
"1108","cue","00:50:43,457","00:50:48,462","I'm not gonna criticize you and be like,
""Oh, you need to be more nurturing..."""
"1109","cue","00:50:48,545","00:50:50,798","That has to be something
that comes organically."
"1110","cue","00:50:50,881","00:50:53,175","If it's the reason to say no at the altar,"
"1111","cue","00:50:53,259","00:50:56,637","it's something I should have
been told or talked to about."
"1112","cue","00:50:56,720","00:50:59,181","-And not be blindsided.
-[Zack] Can I ask you something?"
"1113","cue","00:50:59,932","00:51:01,600","[Vanessa] Sure, Zack.
You want to add to this?"
"1114","cue","00:51:01,684","00:51:05,104","Yeah. I mean, I spoke to Paul
the night before the wedding."
"1115","cue","00:51:05,187","00:51:08,857","He was up till... I think we were
talking at 2:00 a.m. at night."
"1116","cue","00:51:08,941","00:51:11,151","[Vanessa] That was probably
a very long talk between you two."
"1117","cue","00:51:11,235","00:51:12,236","Yeah."
"1118","cue","00:51:12,820","00:51:15,406","And Paul had no idea."
"1119","cue","00:51:15,489","00:51:17,825","Like, he was completely torn."
"1120","cue","00:51:18,826","00:51:20,494","Up to that point, like, he..."
"1121","cue","00:51:20,577","00:51:24,415","I can tell you how long we talked
about the decision he was gonna make"
"1122","cue","00:51:24,498","00:51:25,457","and I don't..."
"1123","cue","00:51:26,250","00:51:27,710","I think he..."
"1124","cue","00:51:29,128","00:51:32,339","was genuinely,
one hundred percent in love with Micah,"
"1125","cue","00:51:32,423","00:51:36,468","and he just didn't feel confident
in making a decision"
"1126","cue","00:51:36,552","00:51:38,762","that would affect them
for the rest of their life."
"1127","cue","00:51:38,846","00:51:41,015","It just felt like he wasn't certain."
"1128","cue","00:51:41,098","00:51:42,599","He didn't have that certainty."
"1129","cue","00:51:42,683","00:51:45,394","I think the thing that
people throw out here is, like,"
"1130","cue","00:51:45,477","00:51:48,105","the short time period
of making that decision."
"1131","cue","00:51:48,689","00:51:52,401","Um, and, like, you have to be able
to have confidence"
"1132","cue","00:51:52,484","00:51:54,695","or at least enough confidence
to take a jump,"
"1133","cue","00:51:54,778","00:51:59,825","and Paul... Paul really thought
about this incredibly deeply."
"1134","cue","00:51:59,908","00:52:01,618","It wasn't something that he was..."
"1135","cue","00:52:01,702","00:52:03,787","-I don't think any of us take regret,
-[Nick] No."
"1136","cue","00:52:03,871","00:52:06,915","like, you didn't throw it to the wind,
but Micah did bring up a good point"
"1137","cue","00:52:06,999","00:52:10,753","that if that is the biggest reason
that maybe you said no,"
"1138","cue","00:52:10,836","00:52:12,963","I think she's right, she deserved to know."
"1139","cue","00:52:13,047","00:52:15,966","Especially if you loved her
as much as you saw, Zack, and you felt,"
"1140","cue","00:52:16,050","00:52:19,011","and, gosh, she felt.
She was about to say yes."
"1141","cue","00:52:19,094","00:52:20,512","Sure, I can agree with that."
"1142","cue","00:52:20,596","00:52:22,973","Like, I could have done
a better job of communicating"
"1143","cue","00:52:23,057","00:52:26,018","the things that I felt
that were missing. Um..."
"1144","cue","00:52:26,101","00:52:27,644","[Nick] Did you think
she was incapable of that change?"
"1145","cue","00:52:27,728","00:52:29,605","Why wouldn't you have brought that up?"
"1146","cue","00:52:29,688","00:52:33,400","No, I don't think she's incapable of it,
but I think it should occur organically."
"1147","cue","00:52:33,484","00:52:36,612","Not me demanding, like,
""Hey, you be this way for me."""
"1148","cue","00:52:36,695","00:52:38,364","You know, it has to be you."
"1149","cue","00:52:38,447","00:52:42,117","And I appreciate
who you are and seeing that, you know."
"1150","cue","00:52:42,201","00:52:45,788","You can't just, like,
request people to be a certain way,"
"1151","cue","00:52:45,871","00:52:48,332","then all of a sudden they are,
and they end up..."
"1152","cue","00:52:48,415","00:52:51,502","If they do that and they just
change themselves to please you,"
"1153","cue","00:52:51,585","00:52:53,962","um, eventually they're gonna begin
to resent that."
"1154","cue","00:52:54,046","00:52:56,298","And then that facade is gonna break down,"
"1155","cue","00:52:56,382","00:52:58,384","and you're not even
gonna recognize that person."
"1156","cue","00:52:58,467","00:53:00,511","And then your relationship will dissolve."
"1157","cue","00:53:00,594","00:53:03,305","So, it has to be organic,
it has to be natural."
"1158","cue","00:53:03,389","00:53:08,852","I think, um, another character
people remember is Micah's friend, Shelby."
"1159","cue","00:53:09,061","00:53:10,938","[audience hooting]"
"1160","cue","00:53:11,021","00:53:12,856","But before I get into all of that..."
"1161","cue","00:53:14,525","00:53:16,902","Do you actually think
she was right, in retrospect?"
"1162","cue","00:53:16,985","00:53:18,946","When she said
that he wasn't the right one for you?"
"1163","cue","00:53:19,947","00:53:20,781","Um..."
"1164","cue","00:53:21,448","00:53:23,200","I think a lot of Shelby's concerns"
"1165","cue","00:53:23,283","00:53:27,371","lied in the fact that
things are moving too quickly."
"1166","cue","00:53:28,163","00:53:29,164","I mean..."
"1167","cue","00:53:29,998","00:53:32,376","she didn't know if it was gonna work,"
"1168","cue","00:53:32,459","00:53:35,254","and she didn't want me to have
my heart broken, which it did."
"1169","cue","00:53:35,712","00:53:38,132","Um, in that way, I think she was right."
"1170","cue","00:53:38,549","00:53:41,135","I think she has a terrible delivery."
"1171","cue","00:53:41,218","00:53:42,845","[audience laughs]"
"1172","cue","00:53:42,928","00:53:46,181","Which I understand, I do, too. Um..."
"1173","cue","00:53:46,974","00:53:50,144","But she never wanted me to get hurt."
"1174","cue","00:53:50,227","00:53:51,395","That was the bottom line."
"1175","cue","00:53:51,478","00:53:54,022","She never wanted me
to run off the altar crying."
"1176","cue","00:53:54,106","00:53:57,025","She never wanted me to have
a failed marriage, and that's where..."
"1177","cue","00:53:57,109","00:53:58,777","that's where so much of her..."
"1178","cue","00:54:00,320","00:54:01,989","feelings came from."
"1179","cue","00:54:02,614","00:54:06,910","And I think even when they first met
at Shelby's birthday party,"
"1180","cue","00:54:06,994","00:54:09,455","I remember my friends asked Paul, like,"
"1181","cue","00:54:09,538","00:54:12,124","""What do you love about Micah?"""
"1182","cue","00:54:12,207","00:54:13,709","Or... And he was like,"
"1183","cue","00:54:15,127","00:54:16,086","""I don't know."""
"1184","cue","00:54:16,170","00:54:19,548","It wasn't because he didn't love me.
I know he loves me or loved me."
"1185","cue","00:54:20,966","00:54:24,386","But a lot of their concern
came from that it didn't feel natural."
"1186","cue","00:54:24,470","00:54:28,348","It wasn't easy for either of us
and we were both trying to get there."
"1187","cue","00:54:28,432","00:54:32,144","We were so in love, but I don't think
we knew what the future looked like."
"1188","cue","00:54:32,227","00:54:34,813","And she was concerned
that the marriage would fail."
"1189","cue","00:54:34,897","00:54:35,731","[Nick] Yeah."
"1190","cue","00:54:35,939","00:54:39,318","Um... not to call y'all out,
but we are doing a reunion,"
"1191","cue","00:54:39,401","00:54:41,528","and I saw some whispering
over there, Zack."
"1192","cue","00:54:42,237","00:54:43,489","What did you tell Paul?"
"1193","cue","00:54:44,281","00:54:46,033","[audience laughs]"
"1194","cue","00:54:46,116","00:54:46,950","Yeah."
"1195","cue","00:54:48,368","00:54:51,413","You know, I just feel...
I'm gonna be real here, Micah, like,"
"1196","cue","00:54:51,497","00:54:54,082","you're coming after Paul here
this whole time."
"1197","cue","00:54:54,166","00:54:56,543","This entire time
when people have been attacking you."
"1198","cue","00:54:56,627","00:54:59,755","Like, Paul has, like, tried to make peace
with you this entire time,"
"1199","cue","00:54:59,838","00:55:00,923","and I see you over there."
"1200","cue","00:55:01,006","00:55:05,177","And I understand this is hard,
but it looks like you're..."
"1201","cue","00:55:05,260","00:55:07,137","Yeah, I'm sorry."
"1202","cue","00:55:07,221","00:55:09,056","It just makes me really angry"
"1203","cue","00:55:09,139","00:55:11,016","because it looks
like you're here for blood."
"1204","cue","00:55:11,099","00:55:12,976","It seems like he's apologizing over here."
"1205","cue","00:55:13,060","00:55:16,480","He's taking accountability
for his actions, and, uh..."
"1206","cue","00:55:17,439","00:55:20,400","[sighs] But what I whispered to Paul was,"
"1207","cue","00:55:21,026","00:55:23,987","what was happening behind cameras
is not what you're seeing."
"1208","cue","00:55:24,071","00:55:27,574","And... what she was saying about Paul,"
"1209","cue","00:55:27,658","00:55:31,870","what people have... have told me
about the conversations that she had,"
"1210","cue","00:55:32,329","00:55:35,541","it sounds like she never was talking
about getting married to Paul."
"1211","cue","00:55:35,624","00:55:39,294","And there are women here
who have told me that, and..."
"1212","cue","00:55:40,337","00:55:42,756","Just to come out here
and try to make Paul look like"
"1213","cue","00:55:42,839","00:55:44,383","this really bad guy that he's not is..."
"1214","cue","00:55:44,466","00:55:47,302","-I have no intention of making Paul bad.
-[Zack] You never defended him..."
"1215","cue","00:55:47,427","00:55:49,054","in that entire interaction."
"1216","cue","00:55:49,137","00:55:51,390","-[Vanessa] Wait, there's a lot to unpack.
-[Nick] You heard that?"
"1217","cue","00:55:51,473","00:55:52,933","[Micah] That's not true. Were you there?"
"1218","cue","00:55:53,016","00:55:54,601","So, who here..."
"1219","cue","00:55:54,685","00:55:55,519","[audience exclaims]"
"1220","cue","00:55:55,602","00:55:57,938","Were you there?
Me and Paul have talked about"
"1221","cue","00:55:58,021","00:56:00,440","what actually happened
when he met her friends."
"1222","cue","00:56:00,524","00:56:03,026","We hung out the entire experience."
"1223","cue","00:56:03,110","00:56:04,111","All three of us."
"1224","cue","00:56:04,194","00:56:05,404","We were all friends."
"1225","cue","00:56:05,487","00:56:07,573","Yeah, it looked terrible.
But you were there."
"1226","cue","00:56:07,656","00:56:10,033","You're not someone that's gonna sit here
and believe the edit."
"1227","cue","00:56:10,117","00:56:12,035","You saw how weird shit looked for you."
"1228","cue","00:56:12,119","00:56:15,330","That's his point, Micah,
we know what happens beyond the edit."
"1229","cue","00:56:15,414","00:56:17,416","-That's what he's saying.
-[Micah] I understand that."
"1230","cue","00:56:17,499","00:56:19,126","But I'm not here to attack Paul."
"1231","cue","00:56:19,209","00:56:21,628","You have to realize,
the things that I've heard"
"1232","cue","00:56:21,712","00:56:24,590","that really hurt and upset me,
I just found out."
"1233","cue","00:56:24,673","00:56:26,300","I'm not here to attack him."
"1234","cue","00:56:26,883","00:56:28,427","I'm here because I'm hurt,"
"1235","cue","00:56:28,510","00:56:32,139","and I just want answers
about things I had never heard before."
"1236","cue","00:56:32,222","00:56:35,642","Zack, you said that people don't think
that she wanted to marry Paul, ever."
"1237","cue","00:56:37,019","00:56:38,645","-I mean, you brought it up, not me.
-Yeah."
"1238","cue","00:56:38,729","00:56:39,563","[audience laughs]"
"1239","cue","00:56:39,646","00:56:42,357","There have been women who have told me"
"1240","cue","00:56:42,441","00:56:44,484","that in the conversations
they had with her,"
"1241","cue","00:56:44,568","00:56:47,904","very rarely did she ever mention
actually getting married to Paul."
"1242","cue","00:56:48,905","00:56:53,076","[Vanessa] Women here, so there's three,
four others I can count."
"1243","cue","00:56:53,160","00:56:56,538","Okay? I don't want to put you on the spot
and make you name names,"
"1244","cue","00:56:56,622","00:56:59,124","'cause there's probably
a LIB code going on."
"1245","cue","00:56:59,207","00:57:01,126","But you're saying very certainly"
"1246","cue","00:57:01,209","00:57:03,420","that people said
that she didn't want to marry him."
"1247","cue","00:57:03,503","00:57:06,006","-She was just out to get him.
-[Zack] It was rarely mentioned."
"1248","cue","00:57:06,089","00:57:07,966","That seems to be
the opinions that I've heard."
"1249","cue","00:57:08,050","00:57:11,887","Um, what I would say is that...
when I was in the car,"
"1250","cue","00:57:11,970","00:57:14,723","from my own experiences with Micah,
driving her back..."
"1251","cue","00:57:15,265","00:57:16,099","Um..."
"1252","cue","00:57:17,935","00:57:19,978","she would talk pretty badly about Paul."
"1253","cue","00:57:20,062","00:57:21,229","-[Vanessa] Can I ask?
-Like what?"
"1254","cue","00:57:21,313","00:57:23,023","Chelsea, you think
she wanted to marry him?"
"1255","cue","00:57:23,106","00:57:24,733","I know nothing about their relationship."
"1256","cue","00:57:24,816","00:57:26,944","-Tiffany, did she want to marry him?
-I'm sorry."
"1257","cue","00:57:27,027","00:57:27,861","Irina?"
"1258","cue","00:57:28,695","00:57:30,280","They were going through this experience"
"1259","cue","00:57:30,364","00:57:31,907","-of both not knowing...
-We found it."
"1260","cue","00:57:31,990","00:57:33,408","[audience laughs]"
"1261","cue","00:57:33,492","00:57:36,328","[Irina] I actually was thinking,
I just know that there was times"
"1262","cue","00:57:36,411","00:57:39,790","me and Zack would talk about,
""You think they're gonna get married?"""
"1263","cue","00:57:39,873","00:57:43,210","It was like... I think that everyone,
we're on a TV show."
"1264","cue","00:57:43,293","00:57:44,795","We don't know what we're..."
"1265","cue","00:57:44,878","00:57:46,964","Many couples didn't know
until they stood up."
"1266","cue","00:57:47,047","00:57:49,967","A show called <i>Love Is Blind</i> where
you say I do or I don't."
"1267","cue","00:57:50,050","00:57:52,386","Yeah, but still,
we're all going through this"
"1268","cue","00:57:52,469","00:57:54,221","not really knowing what to expect."
"1269","cue","00:57:54,763","00:57:57,265","-You know, like, I don't... Yeah.
-[Vanessa] We have some clarity."
"1270","cue","00:57:57,349","00:58:00,936","Can I ask you, did you guys
try and date after the wedding day?"
"1271","cue","00:58:01,019","00:58:02,396","-You did.
-You did?"
"1272","cue","00:58:03,730","00:58:04,773","[Vanessa] How long?"
"1273","cue","00:58:05,816","00:58:08,110","Well, it was pretty brief here in Seattle"
"1274","cue","00:58:08,193","00:58:10,529","because she had to go
back to Arizona. Um..."
"1275","cue","00:58:10,612","00:58:13,323","Then I visited her in Arizona, um..."
"1276","cue","00:58:14,074","00:58:18,453","briefly, where I stayed a weekend,
and it ended pretty quickly after that."
"1277","cue","00:58:19,788","00:58:20,956","-[Nick] All right.
-[Vanessa] Okay."
"1278","cue","00:58:21,039","00:58:24,209","Um, I will say, and again,
you guys went through it,"
"1279","cue","00:58:24,292","00:58:26,253","we will never be able to understand it."
"1280","cue","00:58:26,336","00:58:28,714","Since Season 1, we've been
more removed from you guys"
"1281","cue","00:58:28,797","00:58:31,133","'cause this is your journey,
and you feel what you feel."
"1282","cue","00:58:31,216","00:58:34,428","But on another side, I don't think
that a lot of people are here, Micah,"
"1283","cue","00:58:34,511","00:58:35,762","thinking you're out for blood."
"1284","cue","00:58:35,846","00:58:38,432","I think you do want some answers,
you are hurt as well."
"1285","cue","00:58:38,515","00:58:40,058","I think you both have said your piece,"
"1286","cue","00:58:40,142","00:58:41,727","-and we thank you for coming on.
-[Nick] Yep."
"1287","cue","00:58:41,810","00:58:45,063","[Vanessa] And sharing your journey
and being extremely vulnerable."
"1288","cue","00:58:45,147","00:58:46,440","I know that this is not easy,"
"1289","cue","00:58:46,523","00:58:49,943","and especially that
fourth wall of social media."
"1290","cue","00:58:50,819","00:58:51,737","Guys, let's move on."
"1291","cue","00:58:51,820","00:58:55,365","Now it's time to talk about
our third love triangle this season."
"1292","cue","00:58:55,449","00:58:59,453","That is a triangle of Marshall,
Jackie and Josh."
"1293","cue","00:58:59,536","00:59:02,497","Now Josh came out of nowhere
to sweep Jackie off her feet,"
"1294","cue","00:59:02,581","00:59:03,915","but spoiler alert,"
"1295","cue","00:59:03,999","00:59:07,669","if you haven't been on social media,
they are still very happily together."
"1296","cue","00:59:07,753","00:59:11,214","Let's take a look at how
all this started way back in the pods."
"1297","cue","00:59:11,298","00:59:12,257","Check it out."
"1298","cue","00:59:12,382","00:59:13,633","[music playing in background]"
"1299","cue","00:59:13,717","00:59:15,677","-Hi.
-How's it going?"
"1300","cue","00:59:15,761","00:59:16,678","Good. How are you?"
"1301","cue","00:59:16,762","00:59:19,514","Well, how are you feeling?
I was worried about you."
"1302","cue","00:59:19,598","00:59:22,142","What's going with you?
I'm fine, I'm alive. Hello."
"1303","cue","00:59:22,225","00:59:23,810","-Hello.
-Hello."
"1304","cue","00:59:23,894","00:59:25,437","I'm trying my best."
"1305","cue","00:59:25,520","00:59:27,272","-How are you?
-I'm all right."
"1306","cue","00:59:27,355","00:59:28,440","-Yeah?
-Chilling."
"1307","cue","00:59:28,523","00:59:31,943","{\an8}As soon as I hear your voice,
I'm instantly, like, comfortable."
"1308","cue","00:59:32,027","00:59:33,987","{\an8}-Well, good.
-I'm instantly, like,"
"1309","cue","00:59:34,404","00:59:36,281","{\an8}There's Big Josh, and for me, like,"
"1310","cue","00:59:36,364","00:59:38,909","{\an8}yeah, we for real, real dug in, like..."
"1311","cue","00:59:38,992","00:59:40,118","{\an8}You said it, not me."
"1312","cue","00:59:40,202","00:59:41,661","{\an8}I love our connection."
"1313","cue","00:59:41,745","00:59:44,206","{\an8}I think our connection is,
like, very strong."
"1314","cue","00:59:44,289","00:59:46,666","{\an8}And, like, you're so easy to talk to."
"1315","cue","00:59:46,750","00:59:47,959","{\an8}You're funny as shit."
"1316","cue","00:59:48,043","00:59:51,379","{\an8}Our energies are, like,
on ten when we both come in here."
"1317","cue","00:59:51,463","00:59:53,465","{\an8}I love our connection, like, for real."
"1318","cue","00:59:53,548","00:59:55,842","{\an8}So is it a problem that I'm not, like..."
"1319","cue","00:59:55,926","00:59:57,094","{\an8}I know your other guy."
"1320","cue","00:59:57,844","01:00:00,305","{\an8}He's very, like, romantic"
"1321","cue","01:00:00,388","01:00:03,475","{\an8}and touchy... not touchy-feely,
but just, like..."
"1322","cue","01:00:03,558","01:00:05,852","{\an8}-I'm not like...
-Soft?"
"1323","cue","01:00:06,812","01:00:09,147","{\an8}Yeah, I'm not crying, I'm not...
You know what I'm saying?"
"1324","cue","01:00:09,231","01:00:11,733","{\an8}[Jackelina]
Mmm-hmm. Maybe you're just too hard, man."
"1325","cue","01:00:11,817","01:00:13,610","{\an8}-We're both scared.
-Yeah."
"1326","cue","01:00:14,236","01:00:15,737","{\an8}And I think with time..."
"1327","cue","01:00:16,822","01:00:19,491","{\an8}we just have to learn
how to give ourselves grace."
"1328","cue","01:00:19,574","01:00:21,743","{\an8}-Yeah.
-I think we're so hard on ourselves,"
"1329","cue","01:00:21,827","01:00:24,454","{\an8}and we have to just understand"
"1330","cue","01:00:24,538","01:00:27,541","{\an8}that this is a hard, long process,"
"1331","cue","01:00:27,624","01:00:29,417","{\an8}this is a long road."
"1332","cue","01:00:29,501","01:00:33,004","{\an8}And it's about personal growth,
too, you know."
"1333","cue","01:00:33,088","01:00:36,133","{\an8}Yeah. But I do want you to know
that I really do care about you."
"1334","cue","01:00:36,216","01:00:37,175","{\an8}[Jackelina] I care about you, too."
"1335","cue","01:00:37,259","01:00:41,513","{\an8}And I really enjoy, like...
I enjoy every moment with you."
"1336","cue","01:00:42,681","01:00:44,724","{\an8}I'm not just saying that just to say it."
"1337","cue","01:00:44,808","01:00:45,725","No. I feel the same."
"1338","cue","01:00:45,809","01:00:47,352","With us, it's just not forced."
"1339","cue","01:00:47,435","01:00:48,645","-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?"
"1340","cue","01:00:48,728","01:00:51,106","-It comes natural. Like poop.
-Yeah."
"1341","cue","01:00:51,189","01:00:52,357","We're like poop."
"1342","cue","01:00:52,440","01:00:53,608","Okay, let's not go there."
"1343","cue","01:00:57,821","01:00:59,197","[Vanessa] It comes natural."
"1344","cue","01:00:59,281","01:01:01,241","-Like poop.
-I mean, everybody does it."
"1345","cue","01:01:02,033","01:01:03,702","-Everybody does it.
-Everybody does poop."
"1346","cue","01:01:03,785","01:01:05,453","Everybody does it. It's true."
"1347","cue","01:01:05,537","01:01:08,999","Jackie and Josh are not with us today,"
"1348","cue","01:01:09,082","01:01:13,086","but I was able to chat
with them yesterday over Zoom."
"1349","cue","01:01:13,170","01:01:14,004","Take a look."
"1350","cue","01:01:15,088","01:01:16,464","[Vanessa] Jackie and Josh, thank you guys"
"1351","cue","01:01:16,548","01:01:18,383","for taking the time
to join us from Seattle."
"1352","cue","01:01:18,466","01:01:19,759","You look good."
"1353","cue","01:01:19,843","01:01:20,969","How are things?"
"1354","cue","01:01:21,428","01:01:22,888","-Doing great.
-We're doing good."
"1355","cue","01:01:22,971","01:01:24,890","Y'all have been dating
since the show ended."
"1356","cue","01:01:25,515","01:01:26,433","-Yeah.
-Correct, yeah."
"1357","cue","01:01:26,516","01:01:28,018","You've got a year under your belt."
"1358","cue","01:01:28,101","01:01:30,187","The journey that you took last year"
"1359","cue","01:01:30,270","01:01:33,356","has now been on Netflix
for everyone to see."
"1360","cue","01:01:33,815","01:01:38,069","Anything you want to say to all those
viewers about the show in your voice?"
"1361","cue","01:01:38,153","01:01:43,033","{\an8}So, I have grown within the last year."
"1362","cue","01:01:43,116","01:01:45,243","{\an8}That person that I've seen"
"1363","cue","01:01:45,327","01:01:49,497","{\an8}was a totally different Jackie,
to be honest."
"1364","cue","01:01:50,165","01:01:51,374","I, um..."
"1365","cue","01:01:52,042","01:01:56,504","I will like to clear up some things,
if that is fine with you."
"1366","cue","01:01:56,588","01:01:58,465","-Absolutely.
-Okay."
"1367","cue","01:01:58,548","01:02:01,718","So, I broke up with Marshall"
"1368","cue","01:02:01,801","01:02:04,638","before I saw Josh at the coffee shop."
"1369","cue","01:02:04,721","01:02:07,599","{\an8}It looks like I'm a cheater,
and I am not a cheater."
"1370","cue","01:02:07,682","01:02:09,726","{\an8}And I understand
what you're saying, which..."
"1371","cue","01:02:09,809","01:02:11,394","{\an8}Everyone wants to turn left and right."
"1372","cue","01:02:11,478","01:02:14,731","{\an8}But at that point
by the wedding dress, you knew."
"1373","cue","01:02:14,814","01:02:17,234","{\an8}You knew
you weren't gonna try on a dress"
"1374","cue","01:02:17,317","01:02:19,152","{\an8}to a man that you wouldn't
walk down the aisle"
"1375","cue","01:02:19,236","01:02:21,821","{\an8}and even contemplate the idea slightly of..."
"1376","cue","01:02:22,697","01:02:23,740","{\an8}Maybe."
"1377","cue","01:02:24,241","01:02:25,533","{\an8}-Correct.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1378","cue","01:02:25,617","01:02:28,245","{\an8}Do you remember the moment
that Marshall pushed you,"
"1379","cue","01:02:28,328","01:02:31,414","{\an8}and it was the last straw,
and you're like, ""That's it. I'm done."""
"1380","cue","01:02:31,498","01:02:32,415","{\an8}I do."
"1381","cue","01:02:32,499","01:02:37,671","{\an8}And it happened off camera,
when we are filming the marriage,"
"1382","cue","01:02:37,754","01:02:40,298","{\an8}or when we were filling out
the marriage certificate."
"1383","cue","01:02:40,382","01:02:42,634","{\an8}He had called me a derogatory name."
"1384","cue","01:02:43,093","01:02:46,012","{\an8}And we fought about it
and he left for three days."
"1385","cue","01:02:46,096","01:02:48,515","{\an8}I think what it was, it was a bad joke."
"1386","cue","01:02:48,598","01:02:53,019","{\an8}It was one of those where we were joking,
but it just came off as bad."
"1387","cue","01:02:53,103","01:02:55,063","{\an8}Marshall's gonna be sitting
next to me tomorrow"
"1388","cue","01:02:55,146","01:02:56,398","{\an8}during the live reunion."
"1389","cue","01:02:57,857","01:02:59,901","{\an8}If you could say something to him,"
"1390","cue","01:03:00,402","01:03:01,736","{\an8}what would you say to him?"
"1391","cue","01:03:02,404","01:03:03,738","{\an8}Yeah, I would..."
"1392","cue","01:03:03,822","01:03:07,575","{\an8}I would just say that I take
accountability for my words and actions,"
"1393","cue","01:03:08,201","01:03:10,495","{\an8}and I hope that he would do the same."
"1394","cue","01:03:10,829","01:03:12,831","{\an8}I can take accountability for the fact"
"1395","cue","01:03:12,914","01:03:16,835","{\an8}that I went from zero
to a hundred really quick,"
"1396","cue","01:03:16,918","01:03:21,172","{\an8}and I can sit here and say
that I should have heard him."
"1397","cue","01:03:21,631","01:03:25,677","{\an8}I should have let him speak
without being on the defense."
"1398","cue","01:03:25,760","01:03:28,471","{\an8}We just were not meant to be,
and we both deserve to be happy."
"1399","cue","01:03:28,555","01:03:31,641","{\an8}[Vanessa] You know why?
'Cause you have that guy next to you."
"1400","cue","01:03:31,725","01:03:34,477","{\an8}I'm dying to know... You kept the ring."
"1401","cue","01:03:35,186","01:03:36,521","{\an8}Yes, ma'am. I have the ring."
"1402","cue","01:03:36,604","01:03:39,149","{\an8}She says, ""Yes, ma'am.""
Why do you think he wanted it back?"
"1403","cue","01:03:39,232","01:03:40,859","{\an8}You can be completely candid."
"1404","cue","01:03:41,901","01:03:42,736","{\an8}Hey."
"1405","cue","01:03:44,029","01:03:45,864","{\an8}Marshall wanted the ring back"
"1406","cue","01:03:45,947","01:03:48,616","{\an8}because he wanted to propose
to another castmate."
"1407","cue","01:03:48,700","01:03:50,368","{\an8}-Mmm.
-[Josh] And then broke up two weeks"
"1408","cue","01:03:50,452","01:03:52,287","{\an8}after production stopped filming."
"1409","cue","01:03:52,370","01:03:54,080","{\an8}-Yeah.
-[Vanessa] But guess who didn't?"
"1410","cue","01:03:54,164","01:03:55,832","{\an8}Jackie and Josh. Hey, Josh."
"1411","cue","01:03:55,915","01:03:59,878","{\an8}Anything you want to say
about your role in this love triangle?"
"1412","cue","01:04:00,754","01:04:02,297","{\an8}[Josh] <i>I'm not the type to text somebody.</i>"
"1413","cue","01:04:02,756","01:04:06,134","{\an8}I'm not the type to hit hem up
on any social media."
"1414","cue","01:04:06,217","01:04:08,762","{\an8}If I'm going to say something,
I'm going to say it to your face."
"1415","cue","01:04:08,845","01:04:10,638","{\an8}And so, when I had gotten,"
"1416","cue","01:04:10,722","01:04:12,849","{\an8}...back at Chelsea's birthday party,"
"1417","cue","01:04:12,932","01:04:14,184","{\an8}I was like, ""Heck, yeah."""
"1418","cue","01:04:14,267","01:04:15,435","{\an8}Been cutting a lot of weight."
"1419","cue","01:04:15,518","01:04:18,521","{\an8}I had 18 pounds to cut
for this competition."
"1420","cue","01:04:18,605","01:04:20,607","{\an8}I had cut 12 at the time."
"1421","cue","01:04:21,358","01:04:26,488","{\an8}And I was thinking, love is blind
but love is worth fighting for."
"1422","cue","01:04:28,907","01:04:30,450","{\an8}When you talk about cutting weight,"
"1423","cue","01:04:30,533","01:04:31,951","{\an8}you were saying you were drinking"
"1424","cue","01:04:32,035","01:04:33,495","{\an8}and it probably made you a little..."
"1425","cue","01:04:34,287","01:04:35,622","{\an8}<i>Yes. So, I...</i>"
"1426","cue","01:04:35,705","01:04:37,582","{\an8}Josh, you don't drink on an empty stomach."
"1427","cue","01:04:37,665","01:04:38,583","{\an8}Come on. This is like..."
"1428","cue","01:04:38,666","01:04:40,126","{\an8}[laughing]"
"1429","cue","01:04:40,210","01:04:41,419","{\an8}[continues indistinctly]"
"1430","cue","01:04:41,503","01:04:43,296","{\an8}Take a drink because
I'm shooting my shot."
"1431","cue","01:04:43,380","01:04:44,339","{\an8}It's my one chance."
"1432","cue","01:04:44,422","01:04:47,759","{\an8}When you saw him,
did you immediately know ""That's Josh""?"
"1433","cue","01:04:48,718","01:04:49,761","{\an8}Honestly, i didn't see him."
"1434","cue","01:04:49,844","01:04:52,222","{\an8}I heard his voice first
and I just have P.T.S.D."
"1435","cue","01:04:52,305","01:04:54,641","{\an8}because Josh's voice is so distinct."
"1436","cue","01:04:54,724","01:04:55,725","{\an8}-[Jackie] <i>You know?</i>
-Yeah."
"1437","cue","01:04:55,809","01:04:59,896","{\an8}[Jackie] <i>And then, seeing him
and connecting the voice with the face,</i>"
"1438","cue","01:04:59,979","01:05:02,107","{\an8}<i>it was kind of just like, wow.</i>"
"1439","cue","01:05:02,190","01:05:03,441","{\an8}It gave you all the feels"
"1440","cue","01:05:04,109","01:05:04,943","{\an8}Exactly."
"1441","cue","01:05:05,443","01:05:07,779","{\an8}So, I want to know then,
as the people want to know,"
"1442","cue","01:05:07,862","01:05:10,156","{\an8}what's next for Jackie and Josh?"
"1443","cue","01:05:10,698","01:05:13,159","{\an8}Are we thinking marriage?"
"1444","cue","01:05:13,243","01:05:16,121","{\an8}Are we thinking little JJs?"
"1445","cue","01:05:16,788","01:05:17,831","{\an8}[Jackie] <i>JJ is a little bit.</i>"
"1446","cue","01:05:19,707","01:05:22,043","{\an8}I think we are taking
our time with everything."
"1447","cue","01:05:22,127","01:05:25,380","{\an8}You know what I mean?
I think life comes at you fast"
"1448","cue","01:05:25,463","01:05:27,340","{\an8}and we don't want to rush anything."
"1449","cue","01:05:27,424","01:05:30,051","{\an8}I think, like,
sometimes you can't rush love."
"1450","cue","01:05:30,385","01:05:31,261","{\an8}-You...
-[Josh] <i>We...</i>"
"1451","cue","01:05:32,095","01:05:33,346","{\an8}<i>We live together now.</i>"
"1452","cue","01:05:33,430","01:05:34,889","{\an8}-<i>We've got a dog.</i>
-Okay."
"1453","cue","01:05:34,973","01:05:35,890","{\an8}[Josh] <i>We've got a fish.</i>"
"1454","cue","01:05:35,974","01:05:37,434","{\an8}-[Vanessa] You have a dog?
-Yeah."
"1455","cue","01:05:37,517","01:05:38,977","{\an8}-I'm a girl dad.
-Yeah."
"1456","cue","01:05:39,060","01:05:40,437","[Vanessa laughing]"
"1457","cue","01:05:40,520","01:05:41,729","[Jackie] <i>Got a fish named Rick, too.</i>"
"1458","cue","01:05:41,813","01:05:42,814","Rick the fish."
"1459","cue","01:05:42,897","01:05:44,232","[laughing]"
"1460","cue","01:05:44,315","01:05:45,191","-I love it.
-[Jackie] <i>Yeah.</i>"
"1461","cue","01:05:45,275","01:05:46,276","I love it."
"1462","cue","01:05:46,609","01:05:49,028","Jackie and Josh, thank you
so much for doing this"
"1463","cue","01:05:49,112","01:05:50,655","and sharing so much with us."
"1464","cue","01:05:50,738","01:05:53,074","We are so happy that
through all of the drama,"
"1465","cue","01:05:53,450","01:05:54,784","you guys found each other."
"1466","cue","01:05:54,868","01:05:55,869","Thank you."
"1467","cue","01:05:55,952","01:05:57,954","-<i>Thank you so much. Take it easy.</i>
-[Vanessa] Bye."
"1468","cue","01:05:58,037","01:05:59,080","[Jackie] <i>Bye.</i>"
"1469","cue","01:06:01,583","01:06:03,751","-[Nick] Okay.
-I'll let that marinate for a minute."
"1470","cue","01:06:05,628","01:06:07,881","Because there was a lot
going on here in the audience."
"1471","cue","01:06:07,964","01:06:09,174","[continues indistinctly]"
"1472","cue","01:06:09,257","01:06:11,509","-Lot going on the stage.
-A lot going on the stage."
"1473","cue","01:06:12,177","01:06:16,306","But the only person that we want to know
what's going on in his head is Marshall."
"1474","cue","01:06:16,389","01:06:17,807","-What's up?
-[Vanessa] Hey."
"1475","cue","01:06:18,391","01:06:20,560","Oh, I got some eyebrow action."
"1476","cue","01:06:20,643","01:06:21,686","A lot of eyebrow action."
"1477","cue","01:06:21,769","01:06:22,854","What's up?
What's happening?"
"1478","cue","01:06:23,313","01:06:25,148","[Vanessa] All right. [clears throat]"
"1479","cue","01:06:25,231","01:06:27,400","What do you want to say
after watching that video?"
"1480","cue","01:06:27,484","01:06:28,776","[Marshall] Well, first of all,"
"1481","cue","01:06:28,860","01:06:30,320","a lot happened in that video."
"1482","cue","01:06:30,403","01:06:32,030","-[Vanessa] Okay.
-Let's say that."
"1483","cue","01:06:33,072","01:06:33,907","But..."
"1484","cue","01:06:34,824","01:06:37,035","I think that a lot of people
want me to be reactionary."
"1485","cue","01:06:37,619","01:06:42,415","And I think that it's just best
to just let them have their moment."
"1486","cue","01:06:42,499","01:06:45,710","Because, there's a lot to see
and there's a lot to think back on."
"1487","cue","01:06:45,793","01:06:48,922","And it's hard to watch a video,"
"1488","cue","01:06:49,005","01:06:50,924","however long it was, two or three minutes,"
"1489","cue","01:06:51,007","01:06:53,801","and talk to each point
that I would like to"
"1490","cue","01:06:53,885","01:06:58,139","because I can't quite recollect
what happened in the video."
"1491","cue","01:06:58,223","01:06:59,807","-[Vanessa] I can help you.
-Different here,"
"1492","cue","01:06:59,891","01:07:01,267","-talking to somebody.
-[Vanessa] I hear you."
"1493","cue","01:07:01,351","01:07:03,728","Well, since they aren't here,
we'll start off."
"1494","cue","01:07:03,811","01:07:06,189","She said she never cheated on you."
"1495","cue","01:07:06,272","01:07:08,775","She broke up with you
before she had the date with Josh."
"1496","cue","01:07:08,858","01:07:10,151","The first point she made."
"1497","cue","01:07:10,235","01:07:11,402","Okay."
"1498","cue","01:07:11,486","01:07:12,987","[Vanessa] That's all you have
to say about that?"
"1499","cue","01:07:13,071","01:07:16,366","It doesn't matter
if it was before or a day after,"
"1500","cue","01:07:16,449","01:07:18,826","it's still like,
you're kissing a new dude"
"1501","cue","01:07:18,910","01:07:21,079","immediately after you just
broke up with somebody?"
"1502","cue","01:07:21,162","01:07:22,830","And I was supposed to be what?"
"1503","cue","01:07:22,914","01:07:26,543","So, are you completely blindsided
that she didn't want this to work out,"
"1504","cue","01:07:26,626","01:07:28,211","or did you know
in the back of your mind,"
"1505","cue","01:07:28,294","01:07:30,171","-like, this isn't working out?
-Yeah, I mean..."
"1506","cue","01:07:30,255","01:07:31,256","There's..."
"1507","cue","01:07:32,173","01:07:33,174","There's a lot of..."
"1508","cue","01:07:34,300","01:07:38,513","...things that I feel, like, happened
between Jackie and myself that"
"1509","cue","01:07:39,889","01:07:42,809","it would have inevitably
got to that point."
"1510","cue","01:07:43,643","01:07:46,854","But I think what we
all have to realize is that"
"1511","cue","01:07:46,938","01:07:50,191","that's just the normal ebb and flow
of a relationship."
"1512","cue","01:07:50,275","01:07:52,860","There's going to be tough times
and great times."
"1513","cue","01:07:52,944","01:07:55,113","-So you would have made it to the altar?
-[Marshall] Absolutely."
"1514","cue","01:07:55,196","01:07:57,323","-[Nick] Really?
-I mean, I said it to her in Mexico."
"1515","cue","01:07:57,407","01:07:59,284","I've run away from stuff before."
"1516","cue","01:07:59,367","01:08:01,494","And in this moment,
I was not running away."
"1517","cue","01:08:01,578","01:08:02,412","[Vanessa] Okay."
"1518","cue","01:08:02,495","01:08:06,291","So, looking back, you don't think
you guys splitting was for the best?"
"1519","cue","01:08:06,374","01:08:10,795","You think you could have figured it out
and had a successful marriage?"
"1520","cue","01:08:10,878","01:08:13,381","Well, that's a twofold question."
"1521","cue","01:08:13,464","01:08:16,092","Making it to the altar -
I think that making it to the altar"
"1522","cue","01:08:16,175","01:08:19,137","is the precipice
of this entire experiment,"
"1523","cue","01:08:19,220","01:08:20,722","and that was taken from me."
"1524","cue","01:08:20,805","01:08:23,057","Um, able to have a decision
in that moment,"
"1525","cue","01:08:23,141","01:08:25,977","-I feel like I wasn't able to have that.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1526","cue","01:08:26,060","01:08:28,938","-And I don't know what i would have said.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1527","cue","01:08:29,022","01:08:30,106","But now, it's just..."
"1528","cue","01:08:31,566","01:08:36,070","I mean, back then,
there was no question to answer."
"1529","cue","01:08:36,154","01:08:37,447","There was no ""Will you say I do?"""
"1530","cue","01:08:37,530","01:08:39,073","You don't know
what you'd have said"
"1531","cue","01:08:39,157","01:08:41,159","but you know you would've
made it to that point?"
"1532","cue","01:08:41,242","01:08:43,202","Yeah, and I would have given it
a lot of thought."
"1533","cue","01:08:43,286","01:08:45,830","[Vanessa] So, another thing
she mentioned in that video is..."
"1534","cue","01:08:45,913","01:08:47,790","-To refresh your memory.
-[Marshall] Thank you."
"1535","cue","01:08:47,874","01:08:52,837","Um, is that there was a derogatory comment
that was made."
"1536","cue","01:08:52,920","01:08:55,506","-Do you know what she's talking about?
-I do. I do."
"1537","cue","01:08:55,590","01:08:56,716","[Vanessa] She alleges."
"1538","cue","01:08:57,216","01:08:58,051","Was it true?"
"1539","cue","01:08:58,134","01:09:00,595","Because I looked over and you had
all kind of eyebrow action."
"1540","cue","01:09:00,678","01:09:01,929","Yeah, because there's..."
"1541","cue","01:09:03,640","01:09:05,391","There's a difference between..."
"1542","cue","01:09:06,893","01:09:10,313","...joking with someone
and being able to move on from it"
"1543","cue","01:09:10,396","01:09:12,065","if there's a pressure point."
"1544","cue","01:09:12,940","01:09:14,817","And being able to..."
"1545","cue","01:09:14,901","01:09:18,279","So, joking with someone
and taking that out of context."
"1546","cue","01:09:18,363","01:09:19,197","And..."
"1547","cue","01:09:19,947","01:09:23,951","Spinning it and telling everyone
that I said, that it was a term."
"1548","cue","01:09:25,203","01:09:28,206","Whereas though I feel like
we both were making jabs"
"1549","cue","01:09:28,289","01:09:30,708","and some of those jabs, she wasn't joking."
"1550","cue","01:09:30,792","01:09:33,169","because we can see in her text messages
that were leaked."
"1551","cue","01:09:33,252","01:09:35,588","She thought that was true."
"1552","cue","01:09:35,672","01:09:39,717","In her heart, she felt like whatever
she said to me in that moment was true."
"1553","cue","01:09:39,801","01:09:45,223","So, for people that don't understand,
there were some texts to her friend leaked"
"1554","cue","01:09:45,306","01:09:48,726","and she was talking about you
in a way that's..."
"1555","cue","01:09:50,144","01:09:51,229","...was not kind."
"1556","cue","01:09:51,312","01:09:52,271","Not, not kind."
"1557","cue","01:09:52,355","01:09:55,608","It was more like, ""Yeah...""
Go check it out for yourself."
"1558","cue","01:09:55,692","01:09:57,318","I don't want to put words wrong."
"1559","cue","01:09:58,194","01:10:00,113","But we want to know your part in this?"
"1560","cue","01:10:00,196","01:10:01,864","So, you said it was from both of you."
"1561","cue","01:10:01,948","01:10:02,782","Yeah."
"1562","cue","01:10:02,865","01:10:05,535","[Vanessa] What's the context of what
you said that was derogatory"
"1563","cue","01:10:05,618","01:10:07,328","-that she completely misunderstood?
-Yeah."
"1564","cue","01:10:07,412","01:10:08,621","Yeah, and so..."
"1565","cue","01:10:10,456","01:10:13,084","Jackie's comments
that were made to me,"
"1566","cue","01:10:13,459","01:10:16,713","Uh, where, you know,
she was calling me sweet."
"1567","cue","01:10:17,672","01:10:19,799","-Calling me, you know...
-[Vanessa] We saw those."
"1568","cue","01:10:19,882","01:10:21,926","-I'm asking you about... I apologize.
-I'm going to..."
"1569","cue","01:10:22,009","01:10:26,764","Yeah, so, I felt like
it was my turn to make a jab."
"1570","cue","01:10:26,848","01:10:29,559","And so, I said, you've got
a strong jaw line."
"1571","cue","01:10:29,642","01:10:33,563","I mean, you could have been a man,
for all I know."
"1572","cue","01:10:33,646","01:10:35,982","-[audience exclaims]
-And it was wrong, I know."
"1573","cue","01:10:36,065","01:10:36,899","It was wrong."
"1574","cue","01:10:36,983","01:10:39,694","Wait. You said this while
signing your marriage certificate?"
"1575","cue","01:10:39,777","01:10:41,988","-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-[audience laughs]"
"1576","cue","01:10:42,071","01:10:45,283","This was the night
before we met my family."
"1577","cue","01:10:45,867","01:10:48,286","And I held myself accountable
in that moment."
"1578","cue","01:10:48,369","01:10:53,750","And I knew it was wrong because
she took very clear offense to it."
"1579","cue","01:10:53,833","01:10:57,587","And I knew, I always hold myself
Accountable for stuff in the moment."
"1580","cue","01:10:57,670","01:10:59,672","And even in the morning after,"
"1581","cue","01:10:59,756","01:11:02,467","I held myself accountable and I said,
this will never happen again."
"1582","cue","01:11:02,550","01:11:04,635","And we are just learning each other."
"1583","cue","01:11:04,719","01:11:07,680","We don't really know
what each other's triggers are,"
"1584","cue","01:11:07,764","01:11:09,766","and so, I thought it was a safe space."
"1585","cue","01:11:09,849","01:11:12,894","Because she is coming to me,
calling me out of my own..."
"1586","cue","01:11:12,977","01:11:14,228","[Vanessa] She said those things to you?"
"1587","cue","01:11:14,312","01:11:15,563","The things we saw on the text."
"1588","cue","01:11:15,646","01:11:16,481","She said them to you?"
"1589","cue","01:11:16,564","01:11:18,024","You're saying this was a situation"
"1590","cue","01:11:18,107","01:11:19,233","where you both were joking"
"1591","cue","01:11:19,317","01:11:20,568","-but it went too far?
-[Marshall] Too far."
"1592","cue","01:11:20,651","01:11:23,029","-[Nick] Okay.
-And i take full accountability for that."
"1593","cue","01:11:23,112","01:11:26,115","[Vanessa] I don't know how I'd feel
if you talked about me like that."
"1594","cue","01:11:26,783","01:11:28,659","-I get we're here but...
-[Marshall] For sure."
"1595","cue","01:11:28,743","01:11:31,788","It was definitely wrong
and I take accountability for that."
"1596","cue","01:11:31,871","01:11:35,291","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-However, I did not say a specific term."
"1597","cue","01:11:35,374","01:11:38,252","-You didn't use a derogatory term?
-I didn't use a derogatory term."
"1598","cue","01:11:38,711","01:11:40,880","-I did not.
-[Vanessa] We won't say it here today."
"1599","cue","01:11:40,963","01:11:43,090","-Imagine the word.
-I didn't say that word."
"1600","cue","01:11:43,174","01:11:46,677","-[Vanessa] Okay.
-That word isn't even in my vocabulary."
"1601","cue","01:11:46,761","01:11:47,970","[Vanessa] So, another thing..."
"1602","cue","01:11:48,721","01:11:50,681","I'm on this because you don't remember."
"1603","cue","01:11:50,765","01:11:53,684","-[Marshall] Yeah.
-She mentioned in the video was the ring."
"1604","cue","01:11:53,768","01:11:56,354","Oh, my God.
The ring heard round the world."
"1605","cue","01:11:56,437","01:11:57,438","The damn ring."
"1606","cue","01:11:57,522","01:11:59,732","[audience chuckles]"
"1607","cue","01:11:59,816","01:12:02,235","At first, I was like, ""What?
Okay, what's going on here?"""
"1608","cue","01:12:02,318","01:12:03,736","So when I asked her that question,"
"1609","cue","01:12:03,820","01:12:05,822","Not the response
I thought I was going to get."
"1610","cue","01:12:05,905","01:12:07,865","She was very hell-bent on saying,"
"1611","cue","01:12:07,949","01:12:11,369","You wanted to propose to somebody
and stay on the show,"
"1612","cue","01:12:11,452","01:12:13,788","when I looked at you
you are like, that is not true."
"1613","cue","01:12:14,330","01:12:15,915","So, what is your take on that?"
"1614","cue","01:12:15,998","01:12:20,336","So, the reason why I asked
for the ring back was because it was a..."
"1615","cue","01:12:22,129","01:12:24,757","It was a symbol of my love."
"1616","cue","01:12:25,424","01:12:26,968","You know, we picked out those rings."
"1617","cue","01:12:27,051","01:12:30,346","And in that moment, I looked at the ring
and i said, ""That's for her."""
"1618","cue","01:12:30,429","01:12:34,934","And I felt like she didn't deserve
to have that symbol of my love."
"1619","cue","01:12:36,227","01:12:38,187","[audience applauding]"
"1620","cue","01:12:40,731","01:12:41,566","And..."
"1621","cue","01:12:42,817","01:12:45,653","And ultimately I did not want
to propose to anybody else."
"1622","cue","01:12:45,736","01:12:46,571","[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1623","cue","01:12:46,654","01:12:48,281","-Okay.
-That wasn't the case."
"1624","cue","01:12:48,364","01:12:51,784","And that's really wild
that she would think that,"
"1625","cue","01:12:51,868","01:12:56,289","because she was literally the only person
that i was worried about in the pods."
"1626","cue","01:12:57,123","01:12:58,207","You know what I'm saying?"
"1627","cue","01:12:58,291","01:13:01,168","Weirdest thing is she thought
I was proposing somebody else."
"1628","cue","01:13:01,252","01:13:02,336","So, I'm keeping the ring."
"1629","cue","01:13:03,588","01:13:06,132","But you did date someone else
and you spoke about this."
"1630","cue","01:13:06,215","01:13:08,384","When did you start dating her?"
"1631","cue","01:13:08,467","01:13:10,136","And which cast member?"
"1632","cue","01:13:10,219","01:13:11,804","-So, let's call a spade a spade.
-Okay."
"1633","cue","01:13:12,722","01:13:17,143","How many dates do you classify dating?"
"1634","cue","01:13:17,685","01:13:21,105","Because we went on one singular date."
"1635","cue","01:13:21,731","01:13:25,443","And although we were talking
back and forth, texting, so..."
"1636","cue","01:13:26,235","01:13:27,236","Back it up."
"1637","cue","01:13:27,904","01:13:30,740","Kacia sent me a very beautiful
voice message"
"1638","cue","01:13:30,823","01:13:32,950","the day after Jackie and I broke up."
"1639","cue","01:13:33,034","01:13:34,368","""Hey, I'm thinking about you."
"1640","cue","01:13:34,452","01:13:35,786","""I know you really loved her."
"1641","cue","01:13:35,870","01:13:38,748","-""That really sucks""
-[Vanessa] How did she know you broke up?"
"1642","cue","01:13:38,831","01:13:39,916","Social media."
"1643","cue","01:13:40,249","01:13:45,004","Because she posted...
Because Jackie posted something."
"1644","cue","01:13:45,087","01:13:46,464","[gloating]"
"1645","cue","01:13:47,214","01:13:49,467","-I am putting it together now. Okay.
-[audience chuckles softly]"
"1646","cue","01:13:49,967","01:13:53,971","So, I mean, it was pretty much
known throughout the cast"
"1647","cue","01:13:54,055","01:13:56,682","-that we had broken up.
-So, she came in?"
"1648","cue","01:13:57,475","01:14:02,271","No, not necessarily coming in
but we had a connection in the pods,"
"1649","cue","01:14:02,355","01:14:04,815","and I feel like that was who she is."
"1650","cue","01:14:04,899","01:14:07,526","-Kacia is a very caring and loving person.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1651","cue","01:14:07,610","01:14:09,487","She did that out of kindness
of her heart."
"1652","cue","01:14:09,570","01:14:12,657","And I was like, you know what?"
"1653","cue","01:14:13,866","01:14:14,867","""How you doing?"""
"1654","cue","01:14:14,951","01:14:16,702","-[Marshall chuckles] ""Let's talk.""
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1655","cue","01:14:16,786","01:14:18,746","Uh, and we explored it."
"1656","cue","01:14:18,829","01:14:23,376","But I couldn't move forward
because I wanted to distance myself"
"1657","cue","01:14:23,459","01:14:25,795","from that horrible experience that I had."
"1658","cue","01:14:25,878","01:14:27,797","And I needed time to work on myself."
"1659","cue","01:14:27,880","01:14:30,841","So, Marshall, obviously
she said quite a bit in that video"
"1660","cue","01:14:30,925","01:14:34,804","but she also said quite a bit
on social media and other ways."
"1661","cue","01:14:34,887","01:14:38,557","Um, is there anything that
you want to say to Jackie?"
"1662","cue","01:14:38,641","01:14:39,850","She's on the other side."
"1663","cue","01:14:39,934","01:14:42,353","Anything you want to get off your chest,"
"1664","cue","01:14:43,104","01:14:46,482","correct, say to Jackie in this moment?"
"1665","cue","01:14:48,275","01:14:49,902","There's a lot that I would like to say."
"1666","cue","01:14:50,987","01:14:55,825","However, I feel like we both deserve
to move on from this."
"1667","cue","01:14:56,367","01:15:00,788","And the whole ""you versus me"" thing
needs to die."

"1837","cue","01:22:38,537","01:22:40,038","Take it from me, in married life,"
"1838","cue","01:22:40,122","01:22:41,415","we have to sleep on the couch
from time to time."
"1839","cue","01:22:41,498","01:22:42,332","[all laughing]"
"1840","cue","01:22:42,416","01:22:44,376","-It still happens, it still happens.
-But I always..."
"1841","cue","01:22:44,460","01:22:46,253","There's one thing I do, I wait."
"1842","cue","01:22:46,336","01:22:48,755","If I spend the night on the couch,
I wake up before she does,"
"1843","cue","01:22:48,839","01:22:50,382","-and then I go...
-[Vanessa] You crawl in bed."
"1844","cue","01:22:50,549","01:22:51,925","-Yeah.
-Okay, I like that."
"1845","cue","01:22:52,009","01:22:54,636","I have a question.
I didn't get to ask you earlier, um,"
"1846","cue","01:22:54,720","01:22:57,723","about clarifying your name.
It's such a long, beautiful name."
"1847","cue","01:22:57,806","01:23:00,601","When you said it so beautifully
when you were doing your vows,"
"1848","cue","01:23:00,684","01:23:02,686","I love that you addressed his entire name."
"1849","cue","01:23:02,769","01:23:04,146","His name is in its entirety"
"1850","cue","01:23:04,229","01:23:05,647","-with the background.
-Mmm-hmm."
"1851","cue","01:23:05,731","01:23:08,150","-Kwamie, did you wanna say something?
-[Kwame] Yes, um..."
"1852","cue","01:23:08,442","01:23:12,988","And so there was a moment where I said
that I wanted to introduce myself as Alex."
"1853","cue","01:23:13,113","01:23:15,699","But when it's Kwame, um,
which, by the way,"
"1854","cue","01:23:15,782","01:23:18,118","the rest of that moment
was because I'm proud of my name."
"1855","cue","01:23:18,202","01:23:19,912","For some reason, that's not in there."
"1856","cue","01:23:19,995","01:23:23,874","Um, that was me mentioning that...
I... before I went on the experiment,"
"1857","cue","01:23:23,957","01:23:25,167","I talked to my producer"
"1858","cue","01:23:25,250","01:23:29,588","and kind of talked about how to approach
the experiment in the right way."
"1859","cue","01:23:29,796","01:23:31,131","We talked about not talking"
"1860","cue","01:23:31,215","01:23:32,799","about race or color
for the first few days."
"1861","cue","01:23:32,883","01:23:33,800","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-Right?"
"1862","cue","01:23:33,884","01:23:35,594","My thoughts were,
""Can I make sure"
"1863","cue","01:23:35,677","01:23:37,888","I honor this experiment
for everybody in it."""
"1864","cue","01:23:38,222","01:23:41,433","So if I go by my first name,
maybe it makes sense"
"1865","cue","01:23:41,517","01:23:43,560","because that way,
I'm not like, ""Hey, Kwame,"""
"1866","cue","01:23:43,644","01:23:45,646","then people automatically trying"
"1867","cue","01:23:45,729","01:23:47,981","to put me in an area
where there prejudging, right?"
"1868","cue","01:23:48,065","01:23:51,276","And it helps everybody
take the best out of the experiment."
"1869","cue","01:23:51,443","01:23:53,654","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-And my name is so important to me."
"1870","cue","01:23:53,737","01:23:57,407","I've always gone by Kwame. And so
when I saw the negative reaction to it,"
"1871","cue","01:23:57,533","01:23:59,743","I needed to declare that up.
I love who I am."
"1872","cue","01:23:59,826","01:24:02,329","I love my name, I represent.
That needs to be said."
"1873","cue","01:24:03,038","01:24:03,872","[Vanessa] Yes. Yes."
"1874","cue","01:24:03,956","01:24:05,165","[all applauding]"

the man has spoken."

"1877","cue","01:24:11,296","01:24:14,591","Chelsea, who looks like
a beautiful Barbie, has met his mother,"

next to you,"
"1882","cue","01:24:25,394","01:24:28,355","how happy you guys are together,
how happily married you are"
"1883","cue","01:24:28,438","01:24:30,566","and how special this year
has been for you."
"1884","cue","01:24:30,983","01:24:34,278","I gotta ask you, are you surprised
by the reactions out there"
"1885","cue","01:24:34,361","01:24:37,447","from people who who are shocked
and surprised that you didn't say no..."
"1886","cue","01:24:37,531","01:24:39,074","I'm so glad you asked."
"1887","cue","01:24:39,449","01:24:41,493","-[whooping]
-The floor is hers."
"1888","cue","01:24:41,994","01:24:43,912","-Um, I will say this.
-[Vanessa giggles]"
"1889","cue","01:24:43,996","01:24:48,041","I feel that women feel
the need to explain,"
"1890","cue","01:24:48,417","01:24:50,294","to say they're sorry to defend,"
"1891","cue","01:24:50,377","01:24:52,713","and women need to feel empowered
to make decisions"
"1892","cue","01:24:52,796","01:24:54,423","that are best for themselves. Period."
"1893","cue","01:24:54,548","01:24:56,049","-[audience cheering, applauding]
-[woman 1] Period."
"1894","cue","01:24:58,260","01:25:00,929","That is what I did for me.
That is what I did for us."
"1895","cue","01:25:02,097","01:25:05,183","And I'm so happy that I did,
and I could not be happier."
"1896","cue","01:25:05,309","01:25:07,686","And marriage is not easy.
We have learned that."
"1897","cue","01:25:07,769","01:25:09,271","-[Vanessa] What are you talking about?
-It's not easy."
"1898","cue","01:25:09,354","01:25:10,772","[all laughing]"

It's worth it."

"1901","cue","01:25:14,484","01:25:18,405","I wanted someone to be able to meet me
where I was emotionally,"
"1902","cue","01:25:18,905","01:25:22,159","and Kwame does that.
He also challenges me to be better."
"1903","cue","01:25:22,242","01:25:24,828","I've never had anybody in my life
do that for me."
"1904","cue","01:25:24,953","01:25:26,830","[Vanessa] You know what?
I believe that, um..."
"1905","cue","01:25:27,039","01:25:30,876","I hate to say it, but it's unfortunate
people wanna hate when you are happy"
"1906","cue","01:25:30,959","01:25:33,795","and when you know what you want.
Chelsea, you went for it."
"1907","cue","01:25:33,879","01:25:35,005","But people forget"
"1908","cue","01:25:35,672","01:25:38,800","-Alex Kwame is a grown-ass man.
-[Kwame laughs]"
"1909","cue","01:25:38,884","01:25:40,677","And if he wants the woman,
he's going to get her."
"1910","cue","01:25:40,761","01:25:42,095","He's not trapped."

What do you want to tell them?"
"1915","cue","01:25:51,813","01:25:53,482","You said it beautifully on your Instagram."
"1916","cue","01:25:53,565","01:25:54,566","-Yeah.
-And I loved that."

"1918","cue","01:25:56,068","01:25:57,736","-You don't blame people for what they saw.
-Yeah."
"1919","cue","01:25:57,819","01:26:00,072","You know that this journey
was you guys falling in love."
"1920","cue","01:26:00,155","01:26:03,241","Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna say
something that Bliss said earlier."
"1921","cue","01:26:03,659","01:26:05,994","What you're seeing
was literally less than 1%"
"1922","cue","01:26:06,078","01:26:10,374","It's like a dab on what our entire
relationship has been, you know?"
"1923","cue","01:26:10,457","01:26:15,754","And so what we got to experience together
was what kept us moving forward."
"1924","cue","01:26:15,837","01:26:16,922","It helped us fall in love."
"1925","cue","01:26:17,005","01:26:20,425","And so, no matter what anyone saw,
no matter any depictions or whatever"
"1926","cue","01:26:20,509","01:26:23,261","the case may be like,
we were madly in love."
"1927","cue","01:26:23,428","01:26:26,807","And there was a lot more.
The decision I had to make"
"1928","cue","01:26:26,890","01:26:29,559","was not actually Seattle
versus, like, getting married."
"1929","cue","01:26:29,643","01:26:32,354","It was actually...
I had a much different life."
"1930","cue","01:26:32,521","01:26:35,565","I was a nomad. I was outside
of the country for six months a year."
"1931","cue","01:26:35,649","01:26:37,401","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-And so that was a difficult life"
"1932","cue","01:26:37,484","01:26:38,902","to think about transitioning from."
"1933","cue","01:26:38,985","01:26:41,947","That was what was beautiful
because Chelsea and I sat down"
"1934","cue","01:26:42,030","01:26:43,990","we talked about
transitioning from that life,"
"1935","cue","01:26:44,074","01:26:47,202","and she came at it in such
a beautiful, empathetic and caring way."
"1936","cue","01:26:47,285","01:26:50,205","I knew that if I put that life aside"
"1937","cue","01:26:50,622","01:26:53,166","and I married my dream girl,
we would find that life again,"
"1938","cue","01:26:53,250","01:26:54,459","-and it'd be worth it.
-[Vanessa] Yeah."
"1939","cue","01:26:54,584","01:26:57,963","Can I say something to all of you?
This is true for everybody on this stage."
"1940","cue","01:26:58,046","01:27:00,132","-Uh-oh, Daddy's about to talk
-When you do something like this"
"1941","cue","01:27:00,215","01:27:02,259","and you put yourself on TV
and people watch,"
"1942","cue","01:27:02,342","01:27:05,554","they feel entitled to have an opinion,
and that's fair because it's television."
"1943","cue","01:27:05,971","01:27:07,848","But there's only one truth,"
"1944","cue","01:27:07,931","01:27:10,350","and that's the truth
that you live each and every day."

a lot of noise out there,"

in the grand scheme of things,"

this drama, this hell-bent on fighting."

those two there and those two there."

-[Vanessa] And I agree with that."

to what you were saying, Kwame."

is about drama and fighting."

'cause that's TMI."
"2001","cue","01:29:34,202","01:29:36,538","-Obviously, you're all... [giggling]
-I hope you're all trying."
"2002","cue","01:29:36,621","01:29:38,331","[all laughing]"

"2005","cue","01:29:41,376","01:29:43,712","what are you guys thinking
on the baby timeline?"
"2006","cue","01:29:43,962","01:29:46,631","-Abso...
-You want me to go?"
"2007","cue","01:29:47,090","01:29:49,259","No. I was just gonna say, as of right now,"
"2008","cue","01:29:49,342","01:29:51,469","we're really just trying
to enjoy our marriage."
"2009","cue","01:29:51,678","01:29:53,179","So, like, we're traveling the world,"
"2010","cue","01:29:53,263","01:29:55,599","we're still getting to learn one another."
"2011","cue","01:29:55,682","01:29:58,476","But the thing is, like,
we're so committed to one another."
"2012","cue","01:29:58,810","01:30:02,147","We want to have our lives set
before we bring a life into this world."
"2013","cue","01:30:02,480","01:30:05,817","So it's... it's not about,
""We have to have a baby right away."

"2017","cue","01:30:09,946","01:30:12,532","I was like, ""Jesus,
y'all really put the baby pressure."""

-My god."
"2020","cue","01:30:15,869","01:30:18,455","But, uh, just to echo
kind of what Tif said,"
"2021","cue","01:30:18,538","01:30:20,832","I mean, you know, obviously for us,"
"2022","cue","01:30:21,416","01:30:23,293","and for anybody,
any one of us that got married,"
"2023","cue","01:30:23,376","01:30:26,338","it's such a drastic transition
and definitely for her, like,"

in the show,"
"2025","cue","01:30:28,673","01:30:31,509","but me living in Portland
and her living in Seattle"
"2026","cue","01:30:31,593","01:30:34,095","was like a big thing for us
because with my job and her job"
"2027","cue","01:30:34,179","01:30:35,430","it was pretty much understood that"
"2028","cue","01:30:35,513","01:30:37,182","-she would have to relocate.
-[Nick] Mmm."
"2029","cue","01:30:37,307","01:30:40,977","So, you know, obviously, we went through
a lot of changes as a couple,"
"2030","cue","01:30:41,102","01:30:43,980","but she personally
has made a lot sacrifice"
"2031","cue","01:30:44,064","01:30:46,733","for the sake of our relationship,
and I'm thankful for her."
"2032","cue","01:30:47,025","01:30:50,362","Um, so with that,
we're loving life together."
"2033","cue","01:30:50,528","01:30:51,488","-[Vanessa] But...
-Mmm-hmm."
"2034","cue","01:30:51,863","01:30:53,823","[Vanessa] Brett, how cute
are baby Air Force 1's gonna be?"

We can do..."
"2037","cue","01:30:59,454","01:31:01,915","Hey, listen. When Baby Brown comes..."
"2038","cue","01:31:02,123","01:31:03,750","-Oh, listen.
-Isn't it Baby Brownie?"
"2039","cue","01:31:04,542","01:31:06,294","I ain't gonna call her Baby Brownie."
"2040","cue","01:31:06,378","01:31:07,921","[all laughing]"
"2041","cue","01:31:08,004","01:31:09,714","When Baby Brown gets here..."

"2045","cue","01:31:14,636","01:31:15,887","[man 2] Gotta name it Brown."
"2046","cue","01:31:15,970","01:31:19,724","All right, what about here?
Chelsea and Kwame?"
"2047","cue","01:31:19,808","01:31:21,810","I think when I entered this
like I was, like,"
"2048","cue","01:31:21,893","01:31:23,687","the clock was kind of ticking in my mind."
"2049","cue","01:31:23,770","01:31:27,107","And I think one thing
that's so beautiful about this"
"2050","cue","01:31:27,190","01:31:29,484","is that Kwame...
I had to grow to be with Kwame too."
"2051","cue","01:31:29,567","01:31:31,319","People may not have seen that."
"2052","cue","01:31:31,403","01:31:35,365","Um, but I love my marriage,
and I respect Kwame so much"
"2053","cue","01:31:35,448","01:31:38,576","that I'm like, ""Let's allow.
Let's step back."

when it needs to happen."""
"2055","cue","01:31:41,079","01:31:43,415","It's a beautiful gift
that Kwame could have given me."
"2056","cue","01:31:43,623","01:31:45,208","-[Vanessa] Yeah.
-[Nick] How about you guys?"
"2057","cue","01:31:45,750","01:31:47,377","[Bliss] Well, we do things really fast."
"2058","cue","01:31:47,752","01:31:50,380","Um, our engagement was only two weeks
and a couple of days,"
"2059","cue","01:31:50,463","01:31:52,757","but short.
I can't wait to have his family."
"2060","cue","01:31:52,882","01:31:53,967","[Vanessa] I thought
you were gonna tell me..."

to settle in as a couple"
"2078","cue","01:32:27,709","01:32:29,085","and to create that foundation."
