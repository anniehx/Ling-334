300,cue,"00:14:40,720","00:14:44,000","should just make their way
back to each other."

he's giving you these butterflies,"

everything that Harry wasn't,"

311,cue,"00:15:13,480","00:15:15,960","but there's something
that's just missing there."
312,cue,"00:15:16,040","00:15:18,960","- Like a void filler at the time?

319,cue,"00:15:32,240","00:15:35,720","Maybe Francesca and Harry
may take a step in that direction, too,"
320,cue,"00:15:35,800","00:15:37,440",because they know it's possible.
321,cue,"00:15:37,520","00:15:40,800","Tell Harry exactly how you feel.
Regardless of how he feels."
322,cue,"00:15:40,880","00:15:43,520","- Tell him how you feel first.

327,cue,"00:15:51,400","00:15:54,560","[Francesca] I have no idea
if he even wants to talk to me anymore,"
328,cue,"00:15:54,640","00:15:56,920",or if he just sees me as...
329,cue,"00:15:57,440","00:15:59,320",some little floozy.

610,cue,"00:29:44,040","00:29:46,680","[Matthew] I honestly have
a deep fear of fear."
611,cue,"00:29:47,680","00:29:50,120","I'm scared of denial.
I'm scared of success."
612,cue,"00:29:50,200","00:29:51,880",I have fear of disappointing my family.

615,cue,"00:30:00,320","00:30:01,960","It's just, yeah, fear is..."
616,cue,"00:30:03,720","00:30:04,840",my biggest enemy.
617,cue,"00:30:07,320","00:30:11,360","It's a weird experience, but some of
the strangest things I've done in my life"
618,cue,"00:30:11,440","00:30:13,960","have brought me closer to
the people I've been with at the time."

a basic art qualification to show for it.</i>"

622,cue,"00:30:24,000","00:30:25,880","but at the same time there's fire,
as well."
623,cue,"00:30:25,960","00:30:28,680","But this also symbolizes
blackness and loneliness."
624,cue,"00:30:28,760","00:30:31,120","My pride sometimes stops me
from being who I want to be."
625,cue,"00:30:31,200","00:30:32,920",And the fear of failure.
626,cue,"00:30:35,040","00:30:36,800","It's a lot with trust, isn't it?"
627,cue,"00:30:37,240","00:30:39,600","Finding someone that you can trust,
and letting someone in."
628,cue,"00:30:39,680","00:30:41,480","I think that's the hardest thing
because..."
629,cue,"00:30:42,480","00:30:44,280","in essence,
you're making yourself vulnerable."
630,cue,"00:30:44,760","00:30:46,360",Warriors!
631,cue,"00:30:46,800","00:30:48,080",Now is the time...

the vulnerability in the other person,"

that you've imprinted off of your heart."

- Yes!"
636,cue,"00:31:02,360","00:31:05,320","And allow the other person
to look at the poster"
637,cue,"00:31:05,800","00:31:07,320",while you're looking at theirs.
638,cue,"00:31:07,680","00:31:09,520","Seeing you without judgment,"
639,cue,"00:31:10,200","00:31:15,400","and for being here with you
through this process of letting go"
640,cue,"00:31:15,960","00:31:17,160",and moving forward.

644,cue,"00:31:33,160","00:31:36,120","but has now become
like a younger brother."
645,cue,"00:31:37,440","00:31:38,440",I like Harry.
646,cue,"00:31:39,280","00:31:41,560","[Deva] Allow yourself to be seen,"
647,cue,"00:31:42,080","00:31:43,400",and embrace this man.
648,cue,"00:31:49,760","00:31:51,160",[Harry] I feel like me and Kelz
649,cue,"00:31:51,600","00:31:53,320",broke down some barriers there.
650,cue,"00:31:54,360","00:31:58,160","There is so much stubbornness,
and it sucks."
651,cue,"00:31:58,240","00:31:59,840",It's one of my worst traits.
652,cue,"00:31:59,920","00:32:03,640","Even in this situation with Francesca,
I've just been a stubborn little shit,"
653,cue,"00:32:03,720","00:32:08,480","and I've learned so much about myself
and about my attitude on situations,"
654,cue,"00:32:08,560","00:32:10,120",and that I just need to just...
655,cue,"00:32:11,120","00:32:13,000","Just grow up, essentially."
656,cue,"00:32:14,320","00:32:16,560",I am here with you to get past this.
657,cue,"00:32:17,680","00:32:19,120","- All right.
- I appreciate you, bro."
658,cue,"00:32:22,560","00:32:23,600",[he sniffs]
659,cue,"00:32:28,120","00:32:31,080","[Deva] So, it's no longer
a barrier in your life."
660,cue,"00:32:36,400","00:32:38,720","[Sharron] I already had trust issues
before coming in here."
661,cue,"00:32:38,760","00:32:42,520","I come from a family where I didn't trust
anybody besides my brothers and mom."
662,cue,"00:32:42,600","00:32:44,560",I'm not a person that shows much emotion.
663,cue,"00:32:44,640","00:32:46,280","So, to be able to sit down"
664,cue,"00:32:46,600","00:32:49,480","and put on paper
exactly the things that bother me,"
665,cue,"00:32:49,720","00:32:51,240",allow me to see
666,cue,"00:32:51,320","00:32:54,840","where I needed to grow or where
I needed to kind of find my strengths."

something coming her way."
668,cue,"00:32:58,920","00:33:00,160",This is part of who I am.

of this process,"
674,cue,"00:33:17,200","00:33:20,920","we're going to destroy that very thing
that has been holding you back."

and point it towards..."
676,cue,"00:33:25,920","00:33:26,920",this object...
677,cue,"00:33:29,360","00:33:32,480",this objectified non-truth.
678,cue,"00:33:33,200","00:33:34,640","I'm a heart warrior, man."

Gonna do it with my brothers."
682,cue,"00:33:42,680","00:33:44,760",This is not your truth.
683,cue,"00:33:45,400","00:33:46,880",So leave it in the past.
