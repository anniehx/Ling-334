- Okay."
"700","cue","00:33:42,600","00:33:43,440","<i>Hmm.</i>"
"701","cue","00:33:43,520","00:33:46,440","<i>I get the impression
Kelz is about to feel like a dumbbell.</i>"
"702","cue","00:33:46,960","00:33:47,960","You cool?"
"703","cue","00:33:48,920","00:33:52,520","Obviously, last night,
kind of, just made me think that, like,"
"704","cue","00:33:52,600","00:33:55,160","I'd had some, like, unresolved feelings."
"705","cue","00:33:55,760","00:33:58,920","Harry and I started out,
like, pretty strong."
"706","cue","00:33:59,000","00:34:00,000","So..."
"707","cue","00:34:00,600","00:34:04,840","I think we should just take a step back
and, like, stay friends, for now."
"708","cue","00:34:10,440","00:34:11,440","Cool."
"709","cue","00:34:13,160","00:34:15,040","- Right. I'm gonna carry on working out.
- Okay."
"710","cue","00:34:18,240","00:34:19,240","Sorry."
"711","cue","00:34:20,280","00:34:23,720","<i>That's right, Kelz,
just pump your way through the heartbreak.</i>"
"712","cue","00:34:25,400","00:34:27,920","[Francesca] That did not go
like I wanted it to go."
"713","cue","00:34:28,000","00:34:29,440","[she groans]"
"714","cue","00:34:30,480","00:34:31,400","[he sighs]"
"715","cue","00:34:31,480","00:34:34,360","It's not like...
I don't struggle to get girls, so, like..."
"716","cue","00:34:35,160","00:34:37,960","if she wants to be like that, fine.
All the best to her."
"717","cue","00:34:39,160","00:34:40,160","All the best."
"718","cue","00:34:40,720","00:34:43,760","<i>You're not writing a letter, Kelz.
You just got dumped.</i>"
"719","cue","00:34:43,840","00:34:46,040","<i>Kind regards, Desiree.</i>"
"720","cue","00:34:54,240","00:34:57,080","<i>Now that Sharron
has made amends with David,</i>"
"721","cue","00:34:57,160","00:35:01,240","<i>Lana has arranged a date so he can
talk through his feelings with Rhonda.</i>"
"722","cue","00:35:01,640","00:35:04,440","[Sharron] My plan with Rhonda today is,
lay everything on the table."
"723","cue","00:35:04,520","00:35:06,680","Let her know why I'm feeling
the way I feel."
"724","cue","00:35:06,760","00:35:08,520","I just want to be a better person."
"725","cue","00:35:09,040","00:35:10,360","This is lovely, right?"
"726","cue","00:35:13,680","00:35:18,440","I haven't had a chance to speak to Rhonda,
but I'll put myself on the back burner"
"727","cue","00:35:18,520","00:35:21,160","and move away from the situation,
and they can crack on."
"728","cue","00:35:21,240","00:35:23,560","That's an amazing thing of you to do, man."
"729","cue","00:35:26,360","00:35:29,800","[Rhonda] If you write on paper
my ideal guy, that would be Sharron,"
"730","cue","00:35:29,880","00:35:33,520","but David was able to basically,
kind of, open up"
"731","cue","00:35:33,600","00:35:35,120","and show his emotions."
"732","cue","00:35:35,200","00:35:38,840","This is what I needed from Sharron.
If he does not open up..."
"733","cue","00:35:39,760","00:35:42,840","[sighs]...like,
I don't know what else I can do."
"734","cue","00:35:43,600","00:35:46,200","It's not that I wanted to ignore you,
it was just..."
"735","cue","00:35:46,880","00:35:50,280","I had a lot to think about.
To me, it was just, like, David's my boy."
"736","cue","00:35:50,560","00:35:52,880","- It's basically like my ex...
- Yeah."
"737","cue","00:35:52,960","00:35:55,000","- ...and my old best friend.
- Right."
"738","cue","00:35:55,440","00:35:57,720","He's not my best friend,
but we started building a bond."
"739","cue","00:35:57,800","00:36:00,520","- Mm-hmm.
- My trust, literally, is so fucked up that"
"740","cue","00:36:01,120","00:36:04,360","if there's a slight chance
of anything going wrong,"
"741","cue","00:36:04,440","00:36:05,960","that I just shut down."
"742","cue","00:36:06,440","00:36:08,120","I mean, I'm not blaming you."
"743","cue","00:36:08,200","00:36:10,480","I just need you to understand, like,"
"744","cue","00:36:10,560","00:36:13,200","you shutting down on me,
it makes it difficult."
"745","cue","00:36:14,840","00:36:18,760","I can't progress with you
if you don't open up to me."
"746","cue","00:36:19,600","00:36:21,840","If you really like someone,
like, that's what you do."
"747","cue","00:36:21,920","00:36:23,760","That's the risk you're willing to take."
"748","cue","00:36:26,400","00:36:29,720","<i>Come on, Sharron.
Use what Lana's taught you.</i>"
"749","cue","00:36:31,800","00:36:35,680","Before I came in here, I didn't think
I would possibly fall for anybody else."
"750","cue","00:36:35,760","00:36:38,480","It feels uncomfortable,
but I like it at the same time."
"751","cue","00:36:39,280","00:36:40,800","So, what I'm gonna do, right,"
"752","cue","00:36:41,440","00:36:43,200","I'm gonna vow to you right now,"
"753","cue","00:36:43,480","00:36:47,160","I'm gonna try to let my guard down.
I'm gonna try to communicate better."
"754","cue","00:36:47,920","00:36:49,200","I'm gonna try to trust,"
"755","cue","00:36:49,760","00:36:52,920","even though it's, like, one of the hardest
things for me in the world to do."
"756","cue","00:36:54,480","00:36:55,760","So if you're down, I'm down."
"757","cue","00:36:55,840","00:36:56,840","[she giggles]"
"758","cue","00:36:58,920","00:37:01,240","But no, that's literally
all I was asking for."
"759","cue","00:37:01,640","00:37:03,680","So, I appreciate it... a lot."
"760","cue","00:37:05,480","00:37:07,320","<i>This is adorable!</i>"
"761","cue","00:37:07,400","00:37:10,480","<i>If this isn't worth a green light,
then honestly, I quit right now.</i>"
"762","cue","00:37:10,880","00:37:11,880","[Rhonda] What?"
"763","cue","00:37:11,960","00:37:13,160","You're just so beautiful."

"792","cue","00:38:21,760","00:38:24,160","We made out. We kissed.
It was like a make-up kiss."
"793","cue","00:38:24,240","00:38:27,480","- We did get the green light from Lana.

of chastity so far.</i>"
"811","cue","00:39:10,160","00:39:12,520","- I smell money going away.
- Really?"
"812","cue","00:39:13,720","00:39:16,440","<i>However, there will be
no further green lights this evening.</i>"
"813","cue","00:39:16,920","00:39:20,240","<i>This time alone is a chance
to get to know each other more deeply,</i>"

are you talking about, bro?"
"817","cue","00:39:29,320","00:39:31,000","I told you I was proud of you."
"818","cue","00:39:31,080","00:39:35,040","Sharonda got the secret room.
Didn't even know there was a secret room."
"819","cue","00:39:35,120","00:39:38,080","Thanks, Lana. Can't wait
to have that by my-fucking-self,"
"820","cue","00:39:38,160","00:39:40,000","because everyone in here sucks."
"821","cue","00:39:40,080","00:39:43,080","We'll try not to, uh,
spend it all in one night."
"822","cue","00:39:44,480","00:39:46,320","I don't think
this is gonna be good at all."
"823","cue","00:39:47,360","00:39:48,800","How are you guys feeling about that?"
"824","cue","00:39:49,080","00:39:51,520","The question really is,
how do <i>you </i>feel about it?"
"825","cue","00:39:51,600","00:39:52,800","I'm happy for them."
"826","cue","00:39:53,440","00:39:55,960","I am not gonna get in the way
of something like that."
"827","cue","00:39:56,400","00:39:59,336","Lana is definitely pushing people
to think about things in a different way."
"828","cue","00:39:59,360","00:40:02,600","Former Davids wouldn't have
stepped back and let them"
"829","cue","00:40:02,680","00:40:05,760","kind of create a better bond together."

There's a secret room we could all go..."
"831","cue","00:40:10,200","00:40:11,680","- Yeah!
