- [David] You don't know."
"70","cue","00:03:12,680","00:03:15,120","- That would be ten dollars.
- [David] You don't know, though."

grabbing you, kind of like..."

Like, was it..."

"74","cue","00:03:22,880","00:03:26,280","Imagine if it's, like, head banging
against the wall, legs everywhere."
"75","cue","00:03:26,360","00:03:28,200","I reckon, ten grand."

"80","cue","00:03:41,160","00:03:42,760","is just keep our pants on."
"81","cue","00:03:47,120","00:03:49,280","If I'm gonna take a risk,
I'm gonna run it up."
"82","cue","00:03:49,360","00:03:52,280","If I'm going to make a deduction
causing us to lose money,"
"83","cue","00:03:52,360","00:03:53,360","I'm gonna kiss."
"84","cue","00:03:53,640","00:03:55,280","I'm gonna have sex."
"85","cue","00:03:55,600","00:03:58,200","Look, I'm gonna make it worth it.
So, definitely..."

I want to do it more."

You'll cost us money."

and we have a good laugh, so..."
"97","cue","00:04:27,920","00:04:30,000","- Stop giving me them eyes.

"98","cue","00:04:30,400","00:04:31,440","Are you guys flirting?"
"99","cue","00:04:31,520","00:04:33,720","That was a little flirt,
but she pushed my head away."
"100","cue","00:04:35,880","00:04:38,960","Initially, I had a vibe and a chemistry
going on with Rhonda,"
"101","cue","00:04:39,040","00:04:42,280","but I've got this little friendly banter,"
"102","cue","00:04:42,360","00:04:44,840","kind of witty-goofy thing
going with Chloe,"
"103","cue","00:04:44,920","00:04:47,040","so I want to get to know her more."
"104","cue","00:04:54,560","00:04:57,040","No sex, no kissing for 100K."
"105","cue","00:04:57,120","00:04:59,960","Imagine superheroes
get put on the planet, for example,"
"106","cue","00:05:00,040","00:05:02,800","and suddenly everyone that's amazing
'cause of their own superpowers"
"107","cue","00:05:02,880","00:05:04,800","suddenly gets told, ""By the way,"
"108","cue","00:05:04,880","00:05:07,440","on this planet,

you're the hottest guy, the hottest girl,"
"112","cue","00:05:15,080","00:05:17,240","- if you have 300,000 followers.
- Yeah."
"113","cue","00:05:17,320","00:05:18,880","It's about what's in your head."
"114","cue","00:05:19,400","00:05:21,120","If that's the lesson
Lana wants to teach me,"
"115","cue","00:05:21,160","00:05:23,040","like, look, I'll pick money every time."
"116","cue","00:05:23,760","00:05:27,200","I'll be very upset if anyone
messes with money, extremely upset."
"117","cue","00:05:27,760","00:05:30,480","Even if you all have to escort people
to the toilets,"
"118","cue","00:05:30,560","00:05:31,760","especially the guys."

"123","cue","00:05:42,720","00:05:44,880","for me, very difficult,
to be honest with you."
"124","cue","00:05:44,960","00:05:49,160","But, if this is like a group thing,
well, it's better for the overall..."
"125","cue","00:05:49,240","00:05:52,320","A group should outweigh
your personal needs every single time."
"126","cue","00:05:52,880","00:05:54,320","It's like self-sacrifice."
"127","cue","00:05:54,400","00:05:58,000","It's not easy for anyone
to go an extended period of time"

"129","cue","00:05:59,440","00:06:01,800","That is not a simple task, but..."
"130","cue","00:06:02,200","00:06:06,440","I'll say this one time,
Matthew is definitely on Team Lana,"
"131","cue","00:06:06,800","00:06:07,840","as of right now."

Jesus is the first disciple of Lana.</i>"
"133","cue","00:06:13,200","00:06:16,680","How long can I choose
to try and see the good in someone"
"134","cue","00:06:16,760","00:06:19,040","who consciously acts in a selfish motive"
"135","cue","00:06:19,440","00:06:21,000","to, like, kiss or cuddle someone,"
"136","cue","00:06:21,080","00:06:23,680","because they're putting
their personal needs above the rest."

What would you do?"
"138","cue","00:06:26,240","00:06:28,520","- You can focus on what you can control.
- Yeah, right."
"139","cue","00:06:28,600","00:06:30,560","You're worried
because it's out of your control."
"140","cue","00:06:30,640","00:06:32,560","Exactly my point. That is my concern."
"141","cue","00:06:32,640","00:06:33,880","Look over there now."
"142","cue","00:06:34,440","00:06:36,040","It's like having little kids, isn't it?"
"143","cue","00:06:36,120","00:06:39,080","The more you tell them not to
do something, the more likely they are."
"144","cue","00:06:39,480","00:06:43,120","And so, it's like, so easily could that
become a power move, you know."
"145","cue","00:06:43,480","00:06:44,400","[they giggle]"
"146","cue","00:06:44,480","00:06:45,640","<i>Look out, guys.</i>"

"156","cue","00:07:15,920","00:07:17,880","The closer I've gotten to Rhonda..."
"157","cue","00:07:18,520","00:07:22,480","...boy, the harder it is
to refrain from sex, like..."
"158","cue","00:07:22,920","00:07:24,600","she's just a walking temptation."

"696","cue","00:31:01,240","00:31:03,000","<i>Another Lana loophole?</i>"
"697","cue","00:31:03,080","00:31:04,640","<i>These guys are creative.</i>"
"698","cue","00:31:06,400","00:31:08,120","Better not cost me money."
"699","cue","00:31:08,520","00:31:09,640","Oh, God."

"704","cue","00:31:23,000","00:31:25,800","[laughs] You just spat it on me!"
"705","cue","00:31:25,920","00:31:27,520","[he giggles]"
"706","cue","00:31:28,840","00:31:29,960","We didn't touch."
"707","cue","00:31:30,880","00:31:32,360","<i>Lana has given them a taste</i>"
"708","cue","00:31:32,440","00:31:35,040","<i>- of how things could be...</i>
- Have I got chocolate on my teeth?"
"709","cue","00:31:35,120","00:31:38,240","<i>...and taught them a strawberry
is about as fruity as things can get</i>"
"710","cue","00:31:38,320","00:31:40,120","<i>without costing the big bucks.</i>"
"711","cue","00:31:40,400","00:31:41,880","- We haven't lost any money.
- Yeah."
"712","cue","00:31:41,960","00:31:44,000","And we've made a deeper connection
with each other."
"713","cue","00:31:44,080","00:31:46,200","- Yeah.
- We've had top bantz, a few drinks."
"714","cue","00:31:46,600","00:31:50,080","Obviously, you're very pretty,
fun, outgoing,"
"715","cue","00:31:50,440","00:31:52,600","bubbly, energetic..."
"716","cue","00:31:53,200","00:31:54,520","- Wait.
- ...attractive."
"717","cue","00:31:54,600","00:31:55,760","[David laughs]"
"718","cue","00:31:56,320","00:31:58,240","- I mean, as far as dates go...
- Yeah."
"719","cue","00:31:58,320","00:32:00,680","- ...could you ask for much more?
- When do we get married?"
"720","cue","00:32:00,760","00:32:02,400","[they laugh]"
"721","cue","00:32:03,560","00:32:05,640","Like, I knew that
he fancied me a little bit,"
"722","cue","00:32:05,840","00:32:08,640","but, like, now I know
that he's actually into me..."
"723","cue","00:32:09,120","00:32:12,240","I'm trying to understand
a deeper connection."
"724","cue","00:32:12,720","00:32:15,360","Lana is going to be so proud."
"725","cue","00:32:15,840","00:32:17,400","I feel like I've done her good."
"726","cue","00:32:18,320","00:32:19,520","<i>Let me get this right.</i>"
"727","cue","00:32:19,600","00:32:22,600","<i>Finger sucking and
close encounters of the strawberry kind?</i>"
"728","cue","00:32:22,680","00:32:24,440","<i>We'll call that a five out of ten.</i>"
"729","cue","00:32:24,520","00:32:25,360","[David laughs]"
"730","cue","00:32:25,440","00:32:27,520","<i>But all journeys have to start somewhere,
I guess.</i>"
"731","cue","00:32:34,600","00:32:38,240","<i>It's now been a full 24 hours
since the sex ban,</i>"
"732","cue","00:32:38,440","00:32:40,040","<i>but only 24 minutes</i>"
"733","cue","00:32:40,120","00:32:42,880","<i>since Francesca and Haley
had a bitch about Harry.</i>"
"734","cue","00:32:44,160","00:32:46,920","- I mean, obviously, I'm annoyed.
- I would be, too."
"735","cue","00:32:47,000","00:32:50,480","I feel like the moment
I formed something with someone,"
"736","cue","00:32:50,560","00:32:51,760","it was so frowned upon"
"737","cue","00:32:51,840","00:32:54,960","and that when Chloe's starting
to form something with someone,"
"738","cue","00:32:55,040","00:32:56,696","- it's encouraged.
- [mocking] It's so cute."
"739","cue","00:32:56,720","00:32:58,680","It's like, ""Oh, yeah."
"740","cue","00:32:59,360","00:33:03,160","Chloe... David...""
Then Harry and Francesca, they're like,"
"741","cue","00:33:03,680","00:33:06,040","""What are you guys doing? No, stop."""
"742","cue","00:33:06,120","00:33:07,440","I don't get it."
"743","cue","00:33:07,640","00:33:09,280","Look, I still, deep down,"
"744","cue","00:33:09,360","00:33:12,120","in my, like, inside of my black heart,"
"745","cue","00:33:12,200","00:33:13,960","like, I still kind of care about Harry."
"746","cue","00:33:14,040","00:33:15,120","I know you do."
"747","cue","00:33:15,200","00:33:17,760","'Cause even though
all that shit happened,"
"748","cue","00:33:18,600","00:33:20,720","the fact that I liked him that much
didn't go away."
"749","cue","00:33:21,400","00:33:23,680","- Yeah, it's not going to.
- I hate him, but I still..."
"750","cue","00:33:23,760","00:33:25,760","- There's still feelings.
- I still like him."
"751","cue","00:33:27,640","00:33:31,080","Harry is a hundred percent
the wrong person for Francesca."
"752","cue","00:33:31,160","00:33:33,880","I think he's a douche,
and I think I can help her see that."
"753","cue","00:33:34,440","00:33:36,600","- I'm gonna take a quick shower.
- All right."
"754","cue","00:33:37,000","00:33:38,000","See you then."
"755","cue","00:33:42,480","00:33:45,160","All this shit happened today.
She wasn't getting what she wanted."
"756","cue","00:33:45,240","00:33:48,560","She tried to manipulate the whole crowd
to hate me."
"757","cue","00:33:48,640","00:33:50,480","I think it just hit me like a truck."
"758","cue","00:33:50,560","00:33:51,600","She's toxic."
"759","cue","00:33:51,680","00:33:54,280","- She's so toxic.
- But I feel like she needs control,"
"760","cue","00:33:54,360","00:33:57,000","and when she doesn't have it,
she fiends for it."
"761","cue","00:33:57,080","00:34:00,400","Which is probably why she's single.
She tries to make people jealous and..."
"762","cue","00:34:04,320","00:34:08,480","Why is Harry in bed with Rhonda?
He keeps throwing me under the bus."
"763","cue","00:34:08,560","00:34:12,160","He's turning the group against me,
and I've literally had enough of it."
"764","cue","00:34:12,240","00:34:15,240","He is an asshole,
and I don't want anything to do with him."
"765","cue","00:34:15,320","00:34:17,280","And everyone in this house can suck it."
"766","cue","00:34:17,760","00:34:20,080","I'm over it. They are going to pay."
"767","cue","00:34:22,160","00:34:23,960","I mean, Rhonda was in bed with Harry."
"768","cue","00:34:24,200","00:34:25,760","[Haley] Oh, what the fuck?"
"769","cue","00:34:27,240","00:34:29,400","I would love if we lost everyone money."
"770","cue","00:34:29,800","00:34:30,840","I'm down, we have to."
"771","cue","00:34:30,920","00:34:31,760","Yeah, we have to."
"772","cue","00:34:31,840","00:34:35,120","- And no one's gonna know that it was us.
- We have to!"
"773","cue","00:34:37,040","00:34:38,920","I don't want them to expect it at all."
"774","cue","00:34:39,000","00:34:40,000","Yeah."
"775","cue","00:34:41,240","00:34:42,320","[Haley] What are you doing?"
"776","cue","00:34:42,400","00:34:43,960","Ten points for Gryffindor."
"777","cue","00:34:44,040","00:34:45,120","[Haley giggles]"
"778","cue","00:34:45,520","00:34:47,240","And we're gonna make it all Chloe!"
"779","cue","00:34:47,320","00:34:51,720","- It was you, Chloe!
- We have to, like, go off. Yeah."
"780","cue","00:34:51,800","00:34:54,240","- Who was it? Who?
- Who lit the pot?"
"781","cue","00:34:56,800","00:34:57,640","When do we do it?"
"782","cue","00:34:57,720","00:34:58,840","- Tonight.
- Tonight?"
"783","cue","00:35:02,280","00:35:04,960","We do it in front of the cameras,
she needs to hear us."
"784","cue","00:35:06,360","00:35:07,440","I know, right?"
