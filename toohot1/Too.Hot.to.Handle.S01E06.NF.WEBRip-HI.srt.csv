more tempted, though."

just a deeper sense of peace."

517,cue,"00:25:34,600","00:25:35,600",Hi.
518,cue,"00:25:35,880","00:25:38,360","- What the fuck is up?
- [they cheer]"
519,cue,"00:25:40,280","00:25:42,000",[they laugh]
520,cue,"00:25:42,080","00:25:43,480","[Rhonda] You still walking, so..."
521,cue,"00:25:43,560","00:25:44,640",[she laughs]
522,cue,"00:25:44,720","00:25:47,760","Tell me through it, play by play.
I want to know every detail."
523,cue,"00:25:47,840","00:25:50,520","- Uh, we promised not to do anything.
- Yeah."
524,cue,"00:25:50,600","00:25:53,360",[laughter]
525,cue,"00:25:54,000","00:25:56,960",We took baths and talked about life.
526,cue,"00:25:57,160","00:25:59,640","It was, like, so romantic and so cute."
527,cue,"00:26:00,120","00:26:01,680",And then... [yells]
528,cue,"00:26:01,760","00:26:03,440","- Oh!
- [laughter]"
529,cue,"00:26:05,120","00:26:06,680","All right, look."
530,cue,"00:26:06,760","00:26:07,920","Yeah, she's, uh..."
531,cue,"00:26:08,640","00:26:10,480",It was a lot of fun. [laughs]
532,cue,"00:26:10,560","00:26:11,640",We had sex.
533,cue,"00:26:12,000","00:26:15,160",[gasps] No way! Oh!
534,cue,"00:26:15,240","00:26:18,080","We probably could have gone without it,
but we just felt, like,"
535,cue,"00:26:18,160","00:26:20,320","deep down that's what
we both wanted to do."
536,cue,"00:26:20,760","00:26:22,920",That's so cute!
537,cue,"00:26:23,000","00:26:25,640","I can see that they have
a bit of a stronger bond."
538,cue,"00:26:25,720","00:26:27,960",I do think it did them the world of good.
539,cue,"00:26:28,040","00:26:31,640","<i>Hello? It's done your prize fund
a world of bad.</i>"
540,cue,"00:26:31,720","00:26:32,920",How long did you last?
541,cue,"00:26:33,000","00:26:34,640","Oh, horrible."
542,cue,"00:26:34,720","00:26:36,360","- [laughter]
- Ten seconds."
543,cue,"00:26:36,440","00:26:37,760","- [Harry] It was terrible.
- Yeah!"
544,cue,"00:26:37,800","00:26:38,800",[laughter]
545,cue,"00:26:38,920","00:26:40,760","[Sharron] My boy had a smile
from ear to ear."
546,cue,"00:26:41,160","00:26:42,160","Sometimes,"
547,cue,"00:26:42,240","00:26:44,880","breaking the rules, you may learn more
than following the rules."
548,cue,"00:26:45,440","00:26:49,440","<i>Why are you all so happy?
You're all gonna lose a load of money.</i>"
549,cue,"00:26:49,880","00:26:51,760",<i>Just wait until the accountant finds out.</i>
550,cue,"00:26:51,840","00:26:53,640","- Honestly, it made us closer.
- [man] I bet."
551,cue,"00:26:53,720","00:26:56,480","Of course, man.
Physical interaction makes people closer."
552,cue,"00:26:56,560","00:26:58,240",That's actually cool.
553,cue,"00:26:58,320","00:27:02,800","I feel like we're closer than ever,
and it feels really nice to be like..."
554,cue,"00:27:03,400","00:27:04,400",Lovey dovey.
555,cue,"00:27:07,120","00:27:10,040","[Chloe] They've proved to the group
they've made a genuine connection."
556,cue,"00:27:10,120","00:27:12,200",I just hope I get the same.
557,cue,"00:27:21,640","00:27:24,600","[Chloe] I feel like
I need to speak to Bryce."
558,cue,"00:27:25,040","00:27:28,840","It's just... He...
I know he's not the guy for me."
559,cue,"00:27:29,560","00:27:31,560","- Hi, you.
- Hey, baby girl."
560,cue,"00:27:31,640","00:27:32,800","- You all right?
- I'm good."
561,cue,"00:27:34,960","00:27:36,440",I needed to talk to you.
562,cue,"00:27:36,520","00:27:37,520",Mm-hmm.
563,cue,"00:27:38,480","00:27:40,120",And I've been a bit nervous.
564,cue,"00:27:40,600","00:27:43,840","I don't know if you've picked up,
but I've been a little bit distant."
565,cue,"00:27:43,920","00:27:46,240","Yeah, I was a little concerned.
I was confused."
566,cue,"00:27:46,320","00:27:47,360","- Yeah.
- I didn't wanna..."
567,cue,"00:27:48,680","00:27:50,800","- I didn't wanna chase you.
- No, of course."
568,cue,"00:27:50,880","00:27:54,760","So, I just wanted to say that
you are such a gentleman."
569,cue,"00:27:54,920","00:27:57,160","Listen, when I'm speaking to you, like,"
570,cue,"00:27:57,240","00:27:59,560","I genuinely know
that you're a really nice guy."
571,cue,"00:28:00,880","00:28:03,040",But I don't normally go for nice guys.
572,cue,"00:28:06,640","00:28:07,920",I feel that...
573,cue,"00:28:09,480","00:28:10,840",what I need
574,cue,"00:28:11,240","00:28:13,240","and what I want
are two different things..."
575,cue,"00:28:13,320","00:28:15,200","- Uh-huh.
- And I feel like..."
576,cue,"00:28:15,680","00:28:17,440","Kori's walked in here,"
577,cue,"00:28:17,680","00:28:20,840","and we clicked straight away.
Do you know what I mean, like?"
578,cue,"00:28:21,440","00:28:23,680",I'm still working out whether that's
579,cue,"00:28:24,360","00:28:26,000",super romantically...
580,cue,"00:28:26,320","00:28:28,560","- Yeah. Of course.
- ...because I'm still wary,"
581,cue,"00:28:28,640","00:28:30,080","- still not sure.
- How could you be?"
582,cue,"00:28:31,040","00:28:34,280","But... you gotta really go
for what you want, right?"
583,cue,"00:28:35,400","00:28:37,880","That's all right, don't worry.
Not everyone's the same."
584,cue,"00:28:38,600","00:28:39,600",Yeah.
585,cue,"00:28:40,920","00:28:42,160",[Bryce] Kori and Chloe.
586,cue,"00:28:42,240","00:28:47,520","Obviously, they're similar, more similar,
and I want her to be happy."
587,cue,"00:28:48,280","00:28:51,080","But I just don't want her
to be picking the wrong guy."
588,cue,"00:28:51,400","00:28:54,480","I think that she will realize
real quick that..."
589,cue,"00:28:55,000","00:28:57,280",I probably was the better option.
590,cue,"00:28:59,680","00:29:00,840",A hug and cuddle?
591,cue,"00:29:01,760","00:29:04,720","<i>Never mind, Bryce.
There are plenty more fish in the sea,</i>"
592,cue,"00:29:04,800","00:29:07,080","<i>which, living on a boat,
you'll know already.</i>"
593,cue,"00:29:13,240","00:29:15,600",<i>The walk of shame to the palapa.</i>
594,cue,"00:29:16,000","00:29:17,240",<i>Place your bets.</i>
595,cue,"00:29:17,320","00:29:20,640","<i>How much money was lost
in the private suite last night?</i>"
596,cue,"00:29:20,880","00:29:22,560",<i>This is gonna hurt.</i>
597,cue,"00:29:23,160","00:29:24,560","<i>Lana, take it away.</i>"
598,cue,"00:29:25,240","00:29:26,120",[melodic chime]
599,cue,"00:29:26,200","00:29:28,280",Hey!
600,cue,"00:29:28,360","00:29:29,360",Lana!
601,cue,"00:29:29,600","00:29:30,440",[Lana] <i>Hello.</i>
602,cue,"00:29:30,520","00:29:32,736","- Hello, love.
- [David] What's up, you sexy little minx?"
603,cue,"00:29:32,760","00:29:34,000","[Lana] <i>Harry and Francesca,</i>"

to have sexual intercourse</i>"
605,cue,"00:29:36,800","00:29:39,200","<i>- in the retreat.</i>
- No way!"
606,cue,"00:29:39,280","00:29:41,120","- The fuck?
- Shock."
607,cue,"00:29:41,200","00:29:43,800","<i>This is the most serious rule break
so far,</i>"
608,cue,"00:29:44,200","00:29:47,240","<i>and will therefore incur
a heavy punishment.</i>"
609,cue,"00:29:48,560","00:29:51,680",That's three bags of sand for a kiss.
610,cue,"00:29:52,320","00:29:54,080",A ride would be like 15K.
611,cue,"00:29:57,280","00:29:59,680","[Lana] <i>The fine for this indiscretion
is...</i>"
612,cue,"00:30:01,120","00:30:02,640",Hit us with the magic number.
613,cue,"00:30:05,680","00:30:08,120",<i>...twenty thousand dollars.</i>
614,cue,"00:30:09,480","00:30:11,240","- Oh, shit.
<i>- Ouch.</i>"
615,cue,"00:30:11,320","00:30:12,640",[Kelz coughs]
616,cue,"00:30:12,720","00:30:13,880","<i>Breathe, Kelz. Breathe.</i>"
617,cue,"00:30:14,440","00:30:16,520","[Nicole] Like, what the fuck?"
618,cue,"00:30:16,920","00:30:18,000",Twenty K is a lot.
619,cue,"00:30:19,560","00:30:22,360","Fuck's sake. You know what?
It's become ridiculous, to be honest."
620,cue,"00:30:23,520","00:30:25,200",[Bryce] Twenty grand's a heavy price.
621,cue,"00:30:25,280","00:30:27,640","At this point,
we're not gonna have any money left."
622,cue,"00:30:28,920","00:30:30,080","I'm sorry, guys."
623,cue,"00:30:35,760","00:30:37,720","<i>Fifty-five thousand left, guys.</i>"
624,cue,"00:30:37,800","00:30:40,040","<i>That's not even gonna pay
for your flights home.</i>"
625,cue,"00:30:40,960","00:30:44,000","For what happened last night,
that's a deal. A steal, okay?"
626,cue,"00:30:44,080","00:30:46,400","We've got ourselves a bargain,
to be honest."
627,cue,"00:30:47,640","00:30:52,080","Francesca is priceless to me.
So, $20,000 doesn't mean shit."
628,cue,"00:30:52,160","00:30:54,920","Last night, Lana put on a sale
and was, like, ""Go crazy."""
629,cue,"00:30:55,000","00:30:56,680",[Kelz] 20K doesn't sound like a sale.
630,cue,"00:30:59,320","00:31:00,320",Oh...
631,cue,"00:31:02,160","00:31:03,840",[laughs] Kelz's face.
632,cue,"00:31:06,840","00:31:09,680","<i>Oh, God, can someone please
change the subject?</i>"

634,cue,"00:31:14,600","00:31:16,080",I do have something to talk about.
635,cue,"00:31:18,920","00:31:20,440",There comes a time when...
636,cue,"00:31:21,480","00:31:24,560","the best way for a teacher
to teach something"
637,cue,"00:31:24,960","00:31:27,200",is to remove themselves from the equation.
638,cue,"00:31:29,000","00:31:31,360",I know this is that time for me.
639,cue,"00:31:31,440","00:31:32,520","<i>Uh, what?</i>"
640,cue,"00:31:33,120","00:31:35,920","- My time up here has been...
- [David] No."
641,cue,"00:31:36,320","00:31:37,480","[Matthew]...really awesome,"
642,cue,"00:31:37,680","00:31:40,000","- but it's time for me to go.
- No."
643,cue,"00:31:40,080","00:31:41,520","- No, man.
- No."
644,cue,"00:31:41,600","00:31:45,200","It's just what's best,
and I'm not sad about it, honestly, guys."
645,cue,"00:31:47,480","00:31:48,920",It's time for me to go home.

648,cue,"00:31:52,040","00:31:53,440",It's time for me to go home.
649,cue,"00:31:55,520","00:31:56,680",I've learned a lot.
650,cue,"00:32:02,920","00:32:05,360","I've made awesome friendships
and connections."
651,cue,"00:32:05,720","00:32:07,200",I've gotten to know a...
652,cue,"00:32:08,240","00:32:09,600",group of amazing people.
653,cue,"00:32:11,880","00:32:13,480",In order for me to progress
654,cue,"00:32:13,560","00:32:17,240","and kind of get to that next level
of personal growth,"
655,cue,"00:32:17,400","00:32:19,960","I would've needed to make
an emotional connection, and that..."
656,cue,"00:32:20,560","00:32:21,960",just didn't happen.
657,cue,"00:32:27,440","00:32:28,800",I feel like Matthew...
658,cue,"00:32:29,600","00:32:33,840","is, like, the big brother to everyone
and helps everyone, and, like..."
659,cue,"00:32:34,560","00:32:36,360",I'm just so sad that he's going.
660,cue,"00:32:37,680","00:32:38,680",[he clears his throat]
661,cue,"00:32:40,560","00:32:43,000","It's important for you guys
to know that..."

663,cue,"00:32:47,360","00:32:48,360",that...
664,cue,"00:32:48,560","00:32:50,560",this was awesome for me.
665,cue,"00:32:53,560","00:32:56,800","[Sharron] Matthew, he's an amazing person.
I've learned a lot from him, and..."
666,cue,"00:32:56,880","00:33:01,080","he's helped me become the Sharron
that I've become so far."
667,cue,"00:33:01,720","00:33:04,160","Genuinely, the best part of this
for me was..."
668,cue,"00:33:04,920","00:33:06,520",...was this. You guys.
669,cue,"00:33:06,960","00:33:09,880","[David] I want to thank you
for enriching our lives,"
670,cue,"00:33:09,960","00:33:12,840","and I'm, like, really upset"
671,cue,"00:33:12,920","00:33:14,640","- that you're gonna leave.
- Yeah."
672,cue,"00:33:14,720","00:33:17,640","<i>Maybe it was the 20 grand
that pushed him over the edge.</i>"
673,cue,"00:33:20,840","00:33:23,920","I guess this is how the disciples felt
when Jesus left."
674,cue,"00:33:27,600","00:33:30,200","Kinda wish he had more things
wrong with him, to be honest."
675,cue,"00:33:31,800","00:33:33,000",That's how I got the girls.

into someone's vagina, I know it's not me."
